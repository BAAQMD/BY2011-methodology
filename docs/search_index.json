["02-01-petref-fac-general.html", "2.1 General Refinery Emissions", " 2.1 General Refinery Emissions 2.1.1 Emissions Introduction Petroleum refining involves processing crude oil into consumable products such as fuel gas, lube oil, and grease. To achieve this process, an array of equipment is used to refine crude oil; the emissions that are generated as a byproduct from these processes make up the petroleum refining emissions categories. Emissions reported are those generated via basic refining processes/devices and do not include emissions from refinery fugitives, storage units, and combustion processes (other than flares and blow down systems). These non-included sources are accounted for in other categories of the emission inventory report. Category 10 accounts for emissions from refining processes that involve chemical reactions, such as, but not limited to cracking, polymerization, and reforming. Significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate (PM) emissions are produced during catalytic cracking and coking operations. Category 11 includes all permitted refinery oil/water separation equipment and fugitive emissions from process drains. This category also contains units such as clarifiers and dissolved air flotation systems. Category 12 accounts for emissions from treatment of wastewater at oil refineries. Category 13 contains emissions from cooling systems. Emissions from cooling towers consist of fugitive VOC’s and dissolved gases (such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia) which are leaked through heat exchangers into cooling water. The contaminants are then vaporized into the atmosphere at the cooling tower. Category 14 includes emissions from vacuum producing systems. Vacuum systems are used primarily to distill heavy crude residues which cannot be distilled at atmospheric pressure. Category 15 accounts for all refinery process gas (combustion) emissions from flares and blow down systems. Refinery flares can emit large quantities of organics, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide as well as greenhouse gases. Category 16 includes emissions from all other refinery processes not covered in category 15. Emissions of organic compounds and greenhouse gases from storage tanks, sulfur recovery units, and combustion processes are included in chapters/sections on Petroleum Products, Chemical Plants, and Turbines, respectively. The processes in this category include distillation, hydrogen manufacturing plants, fuel blending. Coke loading and storage facilities account for most of the particulate emissions in this category. Methodologies Emissions for these categories are obtained from point source data in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank). Emissions are updated annually, on a source-by-source basis, using the following inputs: Process material throughputs as reported by the refineries (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by refineries or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by refineries also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county fraction and monthly/daily factors are calculated based on data obtained from the Data Bank. 2.1.2 Trends History Historic emissions have generally varied with refinery throughputs. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credit (IERC). IERC banking emissions are now inventoried separately under categories 298-301. Also, flare source emissions from categories 298 and 299 are now accounted for in category 15. Beginning in December 2003, flare emission monitoring control was implemented for all refineries in the Bay Area. Flare emissions are based upon these monitoring data. In 2010, SOx decreased significantly as a result of an abatement device installation at Valero refinery. Over 90% of SOx emissions were reduced at Valero refinery from prior years.

This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Future flare emissions are difficult to predict, since they are predicated on emergencies and the nature of emergencies which are unknown and unpredictable. However, with the recent passage of refinery flare monitoring and flare minimization plan requirements, flare emissions are expected to remain constant as long as there are no large upset in refinery processes that would warrant increase in flaring activities. Control Refinery emissions are regulated by the District. Regulations 6, 7, 8, and 9 regulate Particulate Matter, Odorous Substances, Organic Compounds, and Inorganic Gaseous Pollutants respectably. Regulation 12, Rules 11 and 12 pertain to flare monitoring and flare minimization plan at Petroleum Refineries. The rule does not mandate reductions. District staff has found that because refiners have looked more closely both at monitoring and the feasibility of flaring reductions, flaring activities at the five Bay Area refineries have dropped dramatically over the past years. The result has been a significant emission reduction that cannot be directly attributed to this rule, but has and will ultimately be reflected in the emissions.

["02-02-petref-fac-fugitive.html", "2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions", " 2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions 2.2.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 17, 18, and 19 contain refinery fugitive emissions from sealed equipment. These emissions are treated as point sources and are unique to each refinery. Emissions occur from process equipment whenever components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict occurrences. Valve and flange leaks account for the bulk of total fugitive emissions while pressure relief valves account for the smallest amount of total fugitive emissions. Methodologies The petroleum refineries are periodically surveyed for the number of mechanical components utilized in an oil refining process. These components include valves, PRVs, pumps, and compressor seals. Individual types of components are summed up and emissions are calculated based on throughputs and specific emission factors. Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutant, mainly total organic compounds, and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from information collected in the District’s data bank. Information such as plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation are also stored in the data bank. 2.2.2 Trends History Historical changes in fugitive emissions in the Bay Area have been due to installation of newer process units that supplement rather than replace old process units.

Control The District adopted control regulations in 1980 for valves and flanges, pump and compressor seals and PRVs. This marked the first step in the control of fugitive emissions. Control for valves vary widely, gas PRVs are 95% controlled, while heavy liquid valves have negligible control. Most common and significant emission sources are the light liquid service valves, and they are controlled by 65 to 72%. In 1997 and 1998, the District combined the three previous regulations 8-18, 8-25, and 8- 28, into a single regulation, Equipment Leaks, # 8-18. Regulation 8-25 was deleted. Regulation 8-28 was changed to focus on episodic emissions from the normal operation of pressure relief valves. During this change the leak standard for only the pressure relief valves was reduced from 10,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm of total organic compounds. In addition, applicability of the new Regulation 8-18 was broadened to include all leaking equipment, not just valves, flanges, and other equipment specifically listed in the earlier regulation. The following table summarizes the limits. FIXME: TABLE OMITTED By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Coatings processes includes mixes, blends, or compounding of paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, shellac, or sealers from raw materials. Ink manufacturing involves mixes, blends or compounding other raw materials to produce the ink. Printing inks consist of pigments, which produce the desired colors, binders which lock the pigment to the substrate, and solvents, usually organic compounds that dissolve the pigments and binders. A majority of the emissions originate from mixing and cleaning operations. Throughput information of each source is reported by the facilities and is stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated by using data on the reported throughput, the specific materials ( i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as supplied by the companies through the District “S” and “G” forms. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies.

Resin is a semi-solid, water insoluble organic material with little or no tendency to crystallize under standard temperature and atmospheric conditions. Resins are the basic components of plastics and other surface coating formulations. Equipment used in the operations and manufacturing of resins include resin reactor vessels and thinning/blending tanks. The manufacturing of resins produces mostly organic emissions. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated based on throughput data, material description (i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as reported by the companies via the Bay Area Air District’s “S” and “G” air permit forms. The District obtain each year, as necessary, updates for the data during the permit renewal process. The data is gathered on a source- by-source basis using the following criteria as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases are also produced in the manufacturing of resins.

["03-03-chem-fac-pharm.html", "3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics", " 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry. The emissions consisted of both point (Category 25) and area (Category 1897) source emissions. Pharmaceuticals manufacturing plants are those producing and/or blending chemicals for use in the formulation and production of pharmaceutical products. These consist of the manufacture, packaging, and sales of chemicals used as medication for humans and animals. Sources of emissions at pharmaceutical plants may come from batch process equipment, such as reactors, distillation units, extractors, centrifuges, filters, crystallizers, dryers, and storage and transfer. Several different products are manufactured at Cosmetics products facilities. Organic chemicals are used as raw materials and solvents; such as ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, etc. are used. Solvent is recovered where convenient, and as a means of cost effectiveness. Emissions from these operations are almost entirely non-methane organic solvents. There is a wide variety of products manufactured from these two industries, which may also include non-pharmaceuticals for preventive medicine and health-enhancement, medicated and non-medicated cosmetics, and food additives. Methodology The amount of solvent usage by the pharmaceutical manufacturers was estimated based on the U.S. Dept. of Commerce “Current Industrial Reports”, and the “Census of Manufacturers”. It was assumed solvent usage from the cosmetics industry was included from this estimate. Using one dollar per gallon of alcohol, the dollar estimate was converted to gallons. This amount was projected for Bay Area use with an annual growth rate of 2.6 % from 1993. It was assumed this is the total solvent usage by the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The average solvent density was assumed to be 6.6 lbs./gal. The District data bank reported point sources from several pharmaceutical companies. Throughput and other data information of each source are reported by the facilities. Emissions are calculated by using these data through the District “S” and “G” forms. It is assumed there are also a number of other smaller pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturers, known as area sources, not included in the District data bank system. Subtracting the total solvent usage estimate from the point source usage yields an area source solvent usage. An uncontrolled emission factor of 330 lbs./1000 gallons is based on a 5% loss of the usage. District Regulation 8, Rule 24, limiting organic compounds emissions from various pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturing operation took effect in July 1984 with an estimated 42% overall control. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was assumed to be uniform. County Distribution The ratio of each County’s population was used to distribute emission into counties. 3.3.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated by using the estimated solvent usage by the industry.

Category 22 contains emissions from sulfuric acid storage tanks at refineries and chemical plants. The emissions of concern from these categories are sulfur dioxide. Abatement devices to treat sulfur recovery units’ tail gas and sulfur dioxide scrubbers at sulfuric acid manufacturing plants have significantly reduced the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted. The emissions data shows that without the District’s controls, 150 tons per day of sulfur dioxide would have been emitted in to the atmosphere instead of approximately 3 tons per day. Category 26 contains all other chemical plant point source emissions. Some of these sources include acid manufacturing plants, kiln burners, and specialty chemicals manufacturing plants. Emissions caused by the combustion of fuels at chemical plants are not accounted for in this category. Category 27 contains fugitive emissions at chemical plants. Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are potential sources that can leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict. In addition, these emissions may be intermittent and vary in intensity over time. According to EPA report (EPA-625/10-84-004, Dec. 1984) 35% of the total emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities are emitted as fugitive emissions. Methodologies These categories contain both point and area source emissions from chemical plants in the District. Most of the emissions (point sources) from chemical plants are accounted for through our permitting processes, however, Category 27 fugitive emissions (area sources) are not. Fugitive emissions for Category 27 were taken as 35% of the total organic emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities (Categories 21 through 26) within the District. The number of equipment components was used as throughput. Emissions for Categories 21, 22, and 26 were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source- by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced in the chemical plant processes.

Bread is produced either by sponge-dough process, brews (or liquid sponges) process, or straight-dough process. Commercial bakeries more often use the sponge-dough process, where ingredients are initially mixed, bread dough fermented from 3 to 5 hours, and then baked in ovens at about 450 °F. Bakery products such as sweet rolls, crackers, pretzels, cakes, cookies, doughnuts, biscuits, etc. are either leavened by yeast or by baking powder. Yeast metabolizes the sugars and starches in the dough during fermentation process. The end product of this chemical reaction is primarily carbon dioxide and ethanol (TOG). The major criteria pollutant emitted from bread baking is primarily ethanol, which is a by-product of the leavening process. Emissions of combustion products from the burning of fuel in the ovens stacks are not considered in this category. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is calculated from the combustion of the ethanol from the bread in an abatement device such as an afterburner. The abatement devices are used on the larger (point source) ovens. There is no CO2 emission data from the fermentation process available at this time. 4.1.2 Methodologies Throughput information from large bakeries are reported and stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Source tests, which are conducted at various times, provide the data for criteria pollutant emission factors. (During the rulemaking process in the late 1980’s, fifteen ovens from six large bakeries in the Bay Area were source tested by the District. Ethanol (TOG) emissions ranged from 0.3 to 7.0 pounds per thousand pounds bread produced, depending on the oven size, operating temperature, and type of product.) As mentioned above, CO2 emissions are estimated from the combustion of ethanol from the bread in an abatement device. Emissions from these larger bakeries are called point sources (Category #28). There are numerous smaller bakeries in the Bay Area, which are not in the Data Bank system. These bakeries use smaller ovens. Source test results showed an emission factor of 5.4 pounds ethanol per ton of bread produced. Emissions from these smaller bakeries are called area sources (Category #935). Throughput data for small bakeries was based on a survey regarding the large bakeries. Small bakeries showed an approximately 37% share of the total bread market. The 2011 average daily throughput from smaller bakeries was calculated to be about 79,676 tons/year. TOG emissions from small bakeries were 1,179 pounds/day (0.59 ton per day) Monthly Variation For large bakeries, monthly distribution was based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. For small bakeries (area sources), monthly distribution was based on a 1990 production of a large bakery, which is assumed to be typical. County Distribution The county locations and associated emissions of each of the large bakeries were used to distribute countywide emissions. For small bakeries, the number of employees in the large bakeries was subtracted from the total number of employees in each county’s bakeries. This data was found in the U.S Census Department’s 2010 County Business Patterns 4.1.3 Trends 4.1.3.1 History Historical emissions were estimated using actual throughputs and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile.

["04-02-indcom-cooking.html", "4.2 Cooking, Charbroiling, Deep Fat Frying, and Unspecified (Griddles)", " 4.2 Cooking, Charbroiling, Deep Fat Frying, and Unspecified (Griddles) 4.2.1 Emissions Introduction This category includes particulate and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the preparation of food for human consumption at eating establishments. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, is also emitted from cooking process in these three categories. Restaurant equipment that contributes to these emissions includes charbroilers (Category 29), deep fat fryers (Category 1710) and griddles (Category 1711). Charbroilers can either be conveyorized or under-fire; both types generally use natural gas, however, under-fire charbroilers may use solid fuels, such as charcoal or wood. Deep-fat fryers may be either gas-fired or electric to heat the cooking oil used to cook the food. Griddles use an exposed metal plate, heated by either gas or electricity, to cook the food. These categories do not include the products of combustion emissions from fuel usage (i.e. natural gas or solid fuels) at these establishments. Those emissions can be found in Categories #307, #1590, or #312. Methodology The District estimated the number of restaurants in operation in the Bay Area with assistance from each county’s health department. Each county health department provided the number of restaurants permitted within their jurisdiction. The District refined the number of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that are less likely to cook, such as delicatessens and ice cream parlors. The District used a 1997 South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) report, “Staff Recommendations Regarding Controlling Emissions from Restaurant Operations”, to estimate the number of charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles used in the Bay Area. The SCAQMD report surveyed the type of equipment that was used in restaurant cooking operations in their district boundaries. This report found approximately 33% of the restaurants operates under-fired charbroilers, 4% operate chain-driven charbroilers, 62% operate deep fat fryers, and 52% operate griddles. The average amount of food cooked on each type of appliance was developed for the California Air Resources Board by the Public Research Institute. Emission factors, developed by the University of California at Riverside and the University of Minnesota, were used to quantify the emissions each type of food cooked on charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles. Total District throughputs for each type of food for each device were calculated by multiplying the amount of food cooked by the number of restaurants with that particular cooking device. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the emission factor by the throughput. The total organic gas (TOG) emitted from these three categories is considered all reactive (i.e. TOG equals ROG). The PM emissions emitted from these three categories are particulate matter less than 10 microns in size (PM10) since it is assumed all particles larger than 10 microns are captured before the outside exhaust. A portion of these PM10 emissions are in the form of condensable vapors. Condensable are vapors in the gaseous form at entry into the ventilation hood, but may condense into particulate form (i.e. liquid or solid state) in the duct works, as it exits the exhaust fan, or in the atmosphere. At the time of this writing, condensable PM is not included in the particulate calculations for these categories. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on seasonal variation of each establishment, which is a higher sale during summer months due to longer daylight hours and warmer weather. County Distribution The number of eating establishments in each county was based on data provided by each of the Bay Area’s county health department. The District refined these numbers of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that were less likely to cook. 4.2.2 Trends History Emissions back to 1996 were estimated based on historical number of eating establishments in the Bay Area as reported in the “Taxable Sales in California (Sales &amp; Use Tax) publications.

During the fermentation process, sugar in the grape juice reacts with yeast to form ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Ethanol is emitted into the atmosphere through evaporation. The amount of ethanol formation is dependent on tank design, length of fermentation period, fermentation temperature, and volume and sugar content of fermenting juice. Sugar content is measured as degrees Brix (grams sugar/100 ml. juice). Methodology Wine production in the Bay Area was estimated based on ARB’s methodology and Wine Institute‘s Grape Crush report. Ethanol emission factors from the two types of wine (White and Red) were derived by the ARB from a computer model developed by Williams and Boulton. The ethanol emission factors per thousand gallons of wine produced for white wine, rose wine, and red wine are listed below: White wine: 2.5 lbs. Rose and Red wine: 6.2 lbs. Using an estimated production of wine as: 41.5% white and 58.5% red wine, a composite emission factor of 4.7 lbs. per thousand gallon of wine produced was derived. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor was derived from the chemical equation. \\[ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + \\text{yeast} \\rightarrow 2\\ C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2\\ CO_{2} \\] Assume that fifty percent of CO2 emissions escaped to atmosphere during fermentation process, the CO2 emission factor of 157.41 lbs. per thousands of gallons of wine was estimated. District’s Regulations 3, adopted on May 21, 2008, defined the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wine fermentation processes was biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The total emissions for this category are determined by multiplying the emission factor and the wine production. This methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5.1). Emissions from point sources are calculated from operating data (throughput, emission factors, control factors, if any, etc.) submitted for each equipment as part of the permit process. This operating data is updated upon renewal of the permit. Monthly Variation The ethanol emissions associated with wine fermentation occurs during the grape crushing season, which generally runs from mid-August through October. County Distribution County distribution was based on the amount of wine production in each county. Alameda, Contra Costa, Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma Counties were assumed to produce wine. 4.3.2 Trends History Prior to Base Year 2005, the throughput had been obtained from the “Final Grape Crush Report” published by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Although phylloxera bugs attack vine rootstock, the wine production in vineyards increased at moderate rate in 1996. ARB revised Winery methodology in September 2004 to reflect current wine production in California.

The area source accounts for the ethanol emissions from aging of brandy. Brandy is produced from a distillation process, separating ethanol and other volatile substances from fermented juices. The brandy is then aged for a period of two to ten years. During the aging process, usually, in 50-gallon oak barrels, there is a considerable amount of ethanol emissions released from the barrels into the atmosphere. The point source portion accounts for organic emissions from brewery sources contained in the District’s Data Bank. Methodology San Joaquin Valley District estimated 4,561,546 gallons of brandy in 2007. The 57,380 barrels of Brandy in Bay Area were estimated based upon the above reported data. An emission factor for a 50-gallon Brandy barrel was derived by the Wine Institute. The assumption being: brandy is 120 proof (60% alcohol) on the average; and alcohol is lost during aging at a rate of 2.5% per year per barrel. This resulted in an emission factor of 4.96 lbs. ethanol per barrel of Brandy. Emissions calculations from the aging of brandy consist of multiplying the emission factor with the amount of brandy barrels in storage in the District. The methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5-2). Monthly Variation Brandy is aged for a period of years, during which emissions are released 365 days per year and 24 hours per day. County Distribution County distribution is based on the number of 50-gallon brandy barrels in each county. Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties are assumed to produce or to store the 50-gallon brandy barrels. 4.4.2 Trends History From 1980 to 1987, estimated emissions were based on the summary report of the number of alcoholic production facilities in California published by U.S. Department of Census. The number of alcoholic production facilities had been reduced in Santa Clara County due to increasing new electronic manufacturers and housing development. However, grape production has increased since 1988; therefore, emissions were estimated to be at constant level during 1988-1990. In 1993, grape crush was down approximately 7 % from the 1992 crush, and 7 % less than the record-large 1982 crush of 3,115,531 tons. Emissions from 1993 to 1998 are assumed to be constant at the 1993 production level.

Foundries and forges process ferrous (iron based) metals, non-ferrous (i.e. aluminum, copper, magnesium, zinc, brass, and bronze), or a combination of both. Metal recycling and shredding facilities collect, sort, and recycle scrap metal. Scrap Metal includes both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and is often shredded. Point sources (Categories 34 and 2222) include various process equipment associated with the foundry, forging and metal recycling and shredding operations. These equipment include furnaces (cupola, electric arc, reverberatory, etc.), temporary mold and core making, metal casting, cooling, shakeout, and sand reclamation, shredders, etc. These equipment are subject to District regulations and the permit system. However, there may be some exempt sources for which permits are not required that are also considered point sources. Emissions associated with these two categories are PM and TOG. In addition to point sources, various other processes and emission sources at these facilities, such as tapping pouring and casting, cooling, shakeout, metal management, sorting separation, open spaces, etc. are the primary sources of fugitive emissions. The fugitive PM emissions from these processes and sources are considered area sources (Categories 2221 and 2223). Methodology Categories 34 and 2222 contain PM and TOG emissions from point sources only. These point source emissions are calculated from operating data submitted for each equipment as part of the permit approval process. Parameters and variables include throughput, emission factors, operating times, batch cycle variables, and stack parameters. For control equipment, the weight percent reduction factors for each pollutant account for emission reduction. Throughput is updated upon permit renewal. The PM and TOG emissions for the point sources are contained in the permit data bank and the summation of these emissions provide the emissions for these categories. Categories 2221 and 2223 contain PM emissions from area sources. Fugitive PM emissions from Category 2221 were estimated using a BAAQMD engineering analysis of PM emission at four of the larger foundries and forges within the District The fugitive PM emissions at three of these facilities were estimated to be between 60% - 85% of the total (fugitive and abated) PM emissions. The fugitive PM emission at other facility, though small, was estimated from its recycling activity. The fugitive emissions and throughput from these facilities were used to estimate an emission factor. This emission factor along with reported throughputs from the smaller foundries and forging facilities within the District provided fugitive PM emissions from these sources. In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2221 was estimated to be 0.61 ton/day. District staff used an engineering analysis of fugitive PM emissions from a recent CEQA analysis conducted for a new facility in West Sacramento, California to estimate fugitive PM emissions from Bay Area scrap metal recycling facilities (Category 2223). In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2223 was estimated to be 0.12 ton/day.

["04-08-indcom-mfg-cement.html", "4.8 Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion", " 4.8 Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion 4.8.1 Emissions Introduction The primary criteria pollutant emission from cement manufacturing is particulate matter. Particulate matter at cement plants are generated during quarrying, crushing, grinding, blending, drying, transfer process, and storage of cement. The largest single source of emissions is the kiln. The cement industry generally uses mechanical collectors, electric precipitators, or baghouses to control emissions. The most desirable method of disposing of the dust collected by an emission control system is injection into kiln burning zone for inclusion in the clinker. Various fuels are used in the kiln for the cement manufacturing process. These fuels have included coke, coal, and natural gas. (As of 2010, coal was no longer as a fuel in the kiln.) Diesel fuel is used in the emergency generators and portable compressors. The emissions from these fuels are the five criteria pollutants, namely PM, organics, NOx, SOx, and CO. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), is also produced during the cement manufacturing process. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the GHG’s emitted during the combustion of the fuels. Methodology These categories contain criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from point sources only. Emissions were individually calculated for each source operation in the District’s Data Bank System. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the specific emission factor for a particular source operation by the throughput. These data are supplied by the permitted facility. The summation of these emissions provides the emissions for these categories. The CO2 emission factor used in the cement manufacturing process was obtained from the California Climate Action Registry’s Cement reporting Protocol. The combustion sources (coke, natural gas. and diesel) GHG emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O were obtained from the Department of Energy (EIA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC). Monthly Variation Monthly and daily production rates follow permitted data supplied by the major cement manufacturer.

Control Two federal rules address air emissions from Portland cement manufacturing, namely New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS). For specific industrial operations (such as cement manufacturing), EPA addresses criteria pollutants from new, modified and reconstructed sources through NSPS. NESHAP address emissions of hazardous air pollutants from both new and existing sources. The cement manufacturing operations are subject to District regulations regarding permitting (Regulation 2-1 and Regulation 2-2), emissions of toxic or hazardous compounds (Regulation 2-5) and some regulations for individual pollutants. For example, Regulation 6-1 reduces particulate emissions from the control imposed by Ringleman requirements. The District adopted Regulation 9-13, Nitrogen Oxide, Particulate Matter, and Toxic Air Contaminants from Portland Cement Manufacturing, on September 17, 2012. This rule becomes effective on September 9, 2013 and limits the emissions of NOx, PM, and toxic air contaminants.

Contaminated soil aeration occurs when soil containing organic compounds is excavated and allowed to vent into the open air. These events include underground gasoline tank removal, soil excavation during pipeline leak repairs, and removal of other organic and petroleum chemical spills. Methodology The District requires a written report for any soil aeration activity. These reports were evaluated to determine a generalized emission factor for each event as well as to estimate the total number of excavations. Regulation 8, Rule 40 allows up to 150 pounds per day of organic compound emissions per aeration event. The organic compound emissions factor was calculated assuming the aeration site starts emitting at 120 pounds per day, with emissions halving every ten days, and with emissions set at zero at the 90th day. Two tank removals or replacements are also assumed to occur per aeration event. On average, about 250 excavation events take place annually in the Bay Area. County Distribution The county activity distribution is based on an average number of aeration events in each county in the District. Monthly Variation The monthly factors are assumed to be uniform. More aeration events are assumed to start during weekdays than during weekends. 4.9.2 Trends History State regulations governing the construction standards of gasoline holding tanks required many stations to replace their existing tanks. In our Source Inventory of 1987, the District had 152 excavation events reported. In 1990, this number had grown to 1254. The number of excavations remained above 1100 per year through the mid 1990s. Growth Table 4.9: Growth profile configuration (DataBank, t1325). category backcast forecast profile #37 Contaminated Soil Aeration TRUE TRUE #250 Soil Evacuation Estimate Much of the increase since 1987 had been due to the Porter and Cologne Act regulated by the State Water Resources Control Board and California Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Parts of these underground tank regulations govern the replacement of underground storage tanks. The California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16 stated that by December 22, 1998, all underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances, other than those containing motor vehicle fuels, need to be retrofitted with secondary containment. By the same date, motor vehicle fuel tanks made of steel needed to be retrofitted with secondary containment or be provided with both interior lining and exterior cathodic protection. The number of excavation events remained at close to the 1990 rate through 1998 and declined afterwards. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 40 on February 15, 1989. The overall control afforded by this rule is 81%. This rule applies for soil aeration events only. Air stripping and soil excavation events are inventoried in category 937, under Regulation 8, Rule 47. Rule 40 sets the rate of uncontrolled aeration in addition to describing an acceptable soil aeration procedure. For an uncontrolled aeration, an operator may not aerate the soil at above certain rate per day; however, the soil aeration may be extended over many days. This does not reduce the total emissions from an aeration event. By: Sukarn Claire Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Soil and groundwater contamination are the result of leaking underground storage tanks, accidental spills and landfill leachate. Air stripping process is commonly used for contaminated groundwater remediation. Contaminated groundwater is pumped into the air-stripping tower. A blower generally exhausts the effluent air stream from the stripping column. The contaminated air stream is routed to an air pollution control device (i.e., carbon adsorbers). Soil vapor extraction is one of the techniques to extract volatile organic compounds (VOC) from contaminated soil through the use of a vacuum system. Fresh air is injected into the subsurface at locations around the contaminated area. The contaminated air is withdrawn under vacuum from extraction wells. This contaminated air is then vented directly to a VOC treatment system such as carbon adsorbers, thermal incinerators, catalytic incinerators, and condensers prior to being released to the atmosphere. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. Point source emissions are calculated from each equipment’s operating data submitted as part of the permit approval process. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company.

Methodology This category contains particulate emissions from point (Category 39) and area sources (Category 1908). For point sources, the data bank contains throughput information submitted by individual concrete batching plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. Cement production for California in 2011 was estimated at 8,833,000 short tons. This was calculated by taking the U.S. production, as provided by the Department of Conservation, Bureau of Mines, and multiplying that figure by the California fraction of the U.S. total. By using the fraction of Bay Area population to that of California, the 2011 cement production in the BAAQMD was estimated at 1,627,190 short tons. The Bay Area’s 2011 concrete production from both point and area sources was estimated at 13,335,670 tons/year (using mixing ratios found in AP-42, page 11.12-7). The 2011 area source throughput of 3,435,624 tons/year was calculated by subtracting the BAAQMD’s total concrete production throughput from the point source throughput. The particulate emission factor used for area source concrete batching, based on Truck Mix Operations (found in AP-42’s Mineral Products Industry section), include total process emissions, wind erosion estimates from sand and aggregate storage piles, and vehicular travel estimates from unpaved roads. The composite particulate emission factor was estimated at 0.16 lbs/ton of concrete produced. Particulate emissions from area sources were calculated by multiplying this emission factor to the estimated area source concrete production throughput in the Bay Area.

Particulates result from volatilization of materials in the melt that combine with gases and form condensates. Emissions from the forming and finishing phase depend upon the type of glass being manufactured. Emissions for glass and related product manufacturing can be categorized by three production phases: raw materials handling, glass melting and refining, and forming and finishing. The raw materials handling phase is the major fugitive dust emissions. The emissions are generated at each of the material transfer points. The emissions from forming and finishing phase are solid particles of glass and related products. (Nitrogen Oxide, NOx, emissions are the result of electric furnace operation; sulfur dioxide, SO2, emissions are the result of glass melting in furnaces.) Methodology Emissions for this category were obtained from point source data only. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by the plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The summation of these emissions provides the emissions for the category. Emissions from storage of organic liquids or combustion of fuels at glass and related product manufacturing facilities are accounted for in other categories.

["04-15-indcom-sandblast.html", "4.15 Sand Blasting", " 4.15 Sand Blasting 4.15.1 Emissions Introduction Abrasive blasting (of which sandblasting is a part) is the use of abrasive materials to clean or prepare a surface, such as metal or masonry. Sand is the most commonly used abrasive material. Other abrasives include coal and smelter slags, glass beads, aluminum oxide, steel shot, walnut shells, garnet, etc. Industries that use abrasive blasting include ship building and repair, aircraft manufacturing, fabricated metal manufacturing, oil and gas extraction industries, aluminum and other nonferrous production and processing industries, etc. There are three types of propelling methods used for abrasive blasting: Dry System where compressed air is used to propel the abrasive using either a suction or pressure type process. A wet system where air or water pressure are used to propel an abrasive slurry to the target surface. Centrifugal Wheel System where centrifugal and inertial forces are used to propel abrasive materials. In many applications, the abrasive materials can be reused. However, once the abrasive’s particle size gets smaller, its stripping efficiency drops and has to be replaced. On the other hand, sand is commonly used for abrasive operations where recycling is not feasible, such as unconfined sand blasting operations. Methodology The District’s Data Bank system contains information on companies with abrasive blasting operations in the Bay Area. These sources are considered point sources. Sand is the most commonly used abrasive material, however there are other abrasive materials used in the Bay Area, such as steel shot, glass beads and aluminum oxide. For emission calculation purposes, it is assumed sand is used in both point (Category 42) and area sources (Category 1909). The other abrasive materials’ usages were in the point sources (Category 42). Throughput Calculations The 2011 sand throughput was estimated from the U. S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) Mineral Commodity Survey. According to this survey, abrasive sand consumed approximately 3.7% of the industrial sand production in 2010. (At the time, this was the latest data available.) California received approximately 4.4% of the total sand produced. The BAAQMD’s percentage of California’s total abrasive sand throughput was approximately 12.6%. This was estimated by using the ratio of the number of employees associated with abrasive blasting (by NAICS) in the District versus California. The following industries were used for this calculation: Ship building and repair (NAICS 3366) Aircraft manufacturing industry (NAICS 336411) Steel product manufacturing industry (NAICS 3312) Aluminum production and processing industry (NAICS 3313) Nonferrous production and processing industry (NAICS 3314) Fabricated metal product manufacturing industry (NAICS 332) Oil and gas extraction industry (NAICS 211) Using these figures, the 2011 estimated total sand throughput in the Bay Area is as follows: 2010 Sand usage in the United States (from the USGS’s Salient U.S. Silica Statistics: \\[\\begin{align} 28,749,347&amp;\\ \\text{ton/yr} \\\\ \\end{align}\\] 2010 Bay Area sand usage for abrasive purposes: \\[\\begin{align} 28,749,347&amp;\\ \\text{ton/yr} \\\\ \\times\\ 0.037&amp;\\ \\text{(for abrasive purposes)} \\\\ \\times\\ 0.044&amp;\\ \\text{(to Calif.)} \\\\ \\times\\ 0.126&amp;\\ \\text{(BAAQMD portion)} \\\\ \\hline = 5,937&amp;\\ \\text{ton/yr} \\end{align}\\] Subtracting out the 2010 point source (permitted) sand throughput of 2,570 tons/year to get the 2010 area source throughput yields: \\[\\begin{align} 5,937 &amp; &amp; \\text{(total)} \\\\ – 2,570 &amp; &amp; \\text{#42 (point)} \\\\ \\hline = 3,367 &amp;\\ \\text{ton/yr} &amp; \\text{#1909 (area)} \\end{align}\\] The 2011 area source throughout of 3,413 tons/year was estimated by multiplying the 2010 area source throughput by the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth factor. Emission Calculation U.S. EPA (1998) recommended particulate emission factors for sand blasting were used for emission calculations. They are as follows: PM: 54 lbs/ton PM10: 26 lbs/ton The 2011 Area Source Sand Blasting emissions (Category 1909) for total particulates (PM) and PM10 in the BAAQMD are as follows: \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM} &amp;=&amp; 3,413\\ \\text{ton/yr} \\times 54\\ \\text{lb/ton} \\div 2000\\ \\text{lb/ton} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 92.15\\ \\text{ton/yr (or 0.25 ton/day)} \\end{eqnarray} \\] \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM}_{10} &amp;=&amp; 3,413\\ \\text{ton/yr} \\times 26\\ \\text{lb/ton} \\div 2000\\ \\text{lb/ton} \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 44.37\\ \\text{ton/yr (or 0.12 ton/day)} \\end{eqnarray} \\] The 2011 point source (Category 42) total particulate emission was 0.10 ton/day. Monthly Variation The monthly variation of emission was estimated to be approximately three times the amount during the period of April through October as opposed to the rest of the year. County Distribution For point sources (Category 42), the data bank system contains information on the county location of each processing plant; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. Emissions from area sources (Category 1909) were distributed to counties by the total employment estimates from those industries listed above by NAICS. 4.15.2 Trends History NOTE: The following chart drops “1995” (CY, RY, and PY) because the PY value is far too large, and crushes the y-axis scale such that nothing else is visible. The historical growth profile (back to 1987) for point sources (Category 42) was based on prior emissions data from the District. The historical growth profile (back to 1991) for area sources (Category 1909) was based on sand production data from the USGS.

["04-16-indcom-mfg-semicond.html", "4.16 Semiconductor Manufacturing", " 4.16 Semiconductor Manufacturing 4.16.1 Emissions Introduction These categories include organic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from semiconductor manufacturing plants and other related integrated circuits manufacturing. Semiconductor manufacturing processes include blank wafer production, semiconductor fabrication, and assembly and packaging. (The following description of the semiconductor manufacturing processes was taken from the BAAQMD’s Permit Handbook, Section 7, Chapter 4.) Blank Wafer Production Silicon Crystal Growth: Molten silicon is introduced into a mold with a seed crystal of silicon. As the molten silicon cools, it crystallizes around the seed to “grow” a single crystalline ingot. Crystal growth is not in itself a source of air emissions and is not subject to permit requirements. Miscellaneous cleaning operations may result in organic or inorganic emissions. Organic cleaning operations may be exempt in accordance with Regulation 2-1-118. Abatement of organic or inorganic emissions may be required if emissions exceed the current best available control technology (BACT) trigger level. Wafer Manufacturing: The cooled silicon ingot is shaped and sliced into round wafers, which are mechanically polished (“lapped”). These steps are subject to the particulate emission limits of Regulation 6 if particulate emissions are produced and vented outside of the facility. Mechanical shaping, slicing and polishing may be exempt from permit requirements in accordance with Regulation 2-1-121.1 or 2-1-125.1.2. After polishing, wafers are etched in a chemical bath to remove surface imperfections. Depending on the type and concentration of etchants used, mists and aerosols may be produced. Finally, each wafer is polished to a smooth finish. The etching operations may be exempt from permitting requirements by Regulation 2-1-127.4, if the toxic risk provisions of Regulation 2-1-316 are satisfied. If adhesives are used to fix wafers in position during polishing, the use of adhesives may be subject to VOC limits and other requirements in Regulation 8, Rule 51. The application of adhesives may be exempt from permit requirements in accordance with Regulation 2-1-119.2, if the toxic risk provisions of Regulation 2-1-316 are satisfied. Miscellaneous cleaning operations may result in organic or inorganic emissions. Organic cleaning operations may be exempt in accordance with Regulation 2-1-118. Abatement of organic or inorganic emissions may be required if emissions exceed the current best available control technology (BACT) trigger level. Semiconductor Manufacturing The processes used to form ICs on the wafer include: Oxidation, where an inert layer of silicon dioxide is formed on the wafer by exposing the wafer to a heated oxygen environment. Photoresist application, exposure and development, where solvent-based, light-sensitive resin solutions are uniformly applied to the wafer and then processed to leave a pattern of cured photoresist on the wafer which corresponds to the circuit image, while removing the non-image coating. Photoresist applicators may also apply non-light sensitive coatings (spin- on-glass, anti-reflective coatings) and solvents (edge bead remover, hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)). Etching, where reactive gases or liquids are used to remove the silicon dioxide layer from the wafer surface where it is not protected by cured photoresist, thereby exposing the underlying silicon for further processing; liquid etching is classified as a wet chemical station, as described below. Photoresist stripping, where cured photoresist is removed from the wafer after it has allowed selective wafer surface processing; stripping solutions may be organic or inorganic depending on the composition of the underlying wafer surface, and therefore may be classified as either solvent stations or a wet chemical stations, as described below. Doping (diffusion, ion implant), where the wafer is exposed to impurities that penetrate into the exposed silicon patterns to selectively modify the electrical conductivity of the silicon, thereby producing electronic components and circuits. Layering (epitaxial growth, metallization films, chemical vapor deposition), where a doped wafer is covered with a uniform layer of silicon (to form a base for additional circuit layers) or metal (to form a conductive connection between the circuit layers and the external IC package). Other processes include: Chemical mechanical polishing (CMP), where wafer surfaces are polished to maintain wafer flatness during processing. Solvent stations, where wafers or tools are cleaned by immersion in a solvent liquid or vapor or by being sprayed with a solvent liquid. Wet chemical stations, where wafers or tools are cleaned or etched by immersion in an inorganic solution or by being sprayed with such a solution. Wipe cleaning, where tools and work surfaces are cleaned in place or at a dedicated station. Assembly and Packaging This is where wafers are cut into individual integrated circuits, which then are mounted into a package for assembly on a printed circuit board. Methodology Category #43. This category contains point sources only where information on equipment, operating data, and throughput of each source are reported by individual semiconductor manufacturing plants and are stored in the District’s Data Bank. Organic emissions and GHG’s are calculated by using the throughput data of specific materials reported and emission factors that are based on various test data and publication. These information are updated upon permit renewal. Category #1891. This category estimates emissions from high global warming potential (GWP) materials (perfluorocarbons, nitrogen trifluoride, and sulfur hexafluoride) in the semiconductor industry. These emissions are considered as area sources. These high GWP GHG emissions were estimated using data from the latest California Air Resources Boards (CARB) “Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory”, California Greenhouse Gas Inventory by IPCC Category, Sixth Edition, 2000 - 2011 (Sector: Industrial: Manufacturing: Electric &amp; Electronic Equipment: Semiconductors &amp; Related Products). From the State level, the Bay Area emissions were calculated using the employee data tables found in the California Department of Finance’s (CDF) 2011 updated Statistical Abstract report. The 2011 Statewide and Bay Area number of employees within the “Computer and Electronic Products” sector were found in Table C- 4 and C-7 of the Statistical Abstract, respectively. The data from these two tables determined the BAAQMD fraction to the State total. Perfluorocarbon emissions are considered total organic gas (TOG) emissions, with no reactive organic gas (ROG) component. They are also considered GHG’s with a range of global warming potential (GWP) values. The 2011 composite GWP value used for calculation purposes was 1,308. Monthly Variation Emissions for both categories were assumed to be uniform for each month of the year. County Distribution Category #43. The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank was used to distribute emissions into each county. Category #1891. The number of employees in each applicable Bay Area county’s, “Computer and Electronic Products” sector was used to determine the county fraction. This data was found in Table C-7 of the 2011 CDF Statistical Abstract report. 4.16.2 Trends History Category 43.

Wastewater streams normally are introduced into the POTW collection system through individual or area drains, which can be open to the atmosphere or sealed to prevent wastewater contact with the atmosphere. Emissions are emitted from wastewater collection, treatment, and storage systems through volatilization of organic compounds at the liquid surface. Methodology Category 50 (POTW) contains organic emissions from point sources only. The emissions in this category are from municipal wastewater treatment plants. All plants operating in the District are in the Data Bank System. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these permitted POTW facilities in Category #50 come from combustion sources only. These GHG, namely CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O are calculated in the combustion source categories (i.e. Category Nos. 291, 292, 304, 307, 312, etc.). Other process and fugitive GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from POTW facilities are estimated as an area source in Category 1911. The CH4 emissions from POTW’s (centralized anaerobic) and the N2O emissions from wastewater treatment effluent emissions and biological denitrification were estimated using the California Air Resources Board’s Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (4th Edition, Category: Waste, IPCC: 4D1 – Wastewater Treatment and Discharge). These area source GHG emissions were estimated for the BAAQMD as a whole and not to any specific POTW facility.

Categories 1157 and 1158 account for organic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from point and area source landfills, respectively. Category 1157 (Point Source Landfills) also has particulate emissions from activities such as vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping, etc. Categories 1686 and 1687 account for point source criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and GHG emissions (CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from the combustion of landfill gases from flares and internal combustion engines (ICE), respectively, at landfills. Landfill gas may also be combusted in ICE’s outside landfills; however, they are covered in Categories 303 (Reciprocating Engines—Gas Fuels) and 305 (Turbines—Gas Fuels). Landfill gas production rates and compositions vary greatly, even within a single landfill. There are no comprehensive data leading to the development of generalized emission factors for the Bay Area. Biodegradation takes place over an extended period of time, therefore, waste generated in prior years must be considered for emissions calculations. It is assumed it takes 15 years for maximum biodegradation to take place. However, biodegradation occurs, to a lesser extent, 35 years and beyond. (For emission calculation purposes in Categories 1157 and 1158, 40 years for biodegradation was used.) Prior to the mid-1960’s, it was assumed that 60% of the waste was buried in landfills and 40% of the waste was burned on-site. After that it was assumed the burned waste was diverted to the landfills. Methodology Point Sources It is assumed all active landfills within the District are permitted sources. Inactive landfills less than 30 years old and have greater than one million tons of refuse in place are also considered permitted. These permitted landfills are considered to be point sources; their throughput and emission information has been inventoried in the District’s database since the early 1980’s. Although most point source landfills have collection systems associated with them, there are several landfills that do not have a collection system. Landfills with Collection Systems For those landfills with active collection systems, it is assumed that 25% escapes as fugitive landfill gas 75% of the gases are captured and are either destroyed by flaring or burned in an internal combustion engine (ICE) or turbine. Those captured gases that are flared or burned in an ICE or turbine are accounted for and reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) under our combustion “C” sources. The following are a list of source codes associated with the criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from landfills with collection systems: G7145511. The throughput associated with this source code represents the amount of landfill gas collected for a particular year. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive methane and GHG emissions from this source based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas collection system captures 75% of the total amount of landfill gas generated at the site (AP-42, Chapter 2.4); the remaining 25% of landfill gas is assumed to be fugitive emissions. Landfill gas, on average, contains 55% methane (CH4), 40% carbon dioxide (CO2), with the remaining 5% nitrogen, oxygen, non-methane organic compounds, etc. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (Category: Managed waste Disposal Sites, Sector: Industrial: Landfills, not specified). Constants used in the emission factor calculations are as follows: The standard molar volume of gases is 387.006 scf/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CH4 is 16.043 lbs/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.010 lbs/lb-mole. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Combustion Sources Using Landfill Gas. The assumed 75% landfill gases captured are combusted in the “C” sources by flaring or used as fuel in turbines or IC engines. A 99% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed for flaring operations; a 97% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed when landfill gas is burned in an internal combustion engine. A slightly higher TOG destruction efficiency, 99% or more, is achieved in turbines. Particulate, NOx, SOx, and CO emissions are also considered as products of combustion. Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions are also calculated from these combustion sources. The CH4 and CO2 emission factors were based from both EPA AP-42 and District sources. The N2O emission factor was based on California Energy Commission data. The CO2 emissions emitted from these combustion sources are considered to be biogenic. G7145580. This source code represents the fugitive ROG emissions with throughput given as the amount of refuse as tons-in-place. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145540. This source code represents fugitive ROG emissions from the on-site handling of contaminated soils. This soil is usually contaminated from gasoline or diesel, and the units associated with this material code are in tons/yr. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145466. This source code represents particulate PM10 emissions from landfill activity that includes vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping and dumping activities, wind erosion from land cover, etc. Throughput is based on tons of incoming waste for a particular year. Landfills without Collection Systems For those few landfills without collection systems, the following is the source code associated with this type of landfill: G7159580. The throughput from this source code represents the total tons in place of refuse. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive organic and GHG emissions from this type of landfill based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas generation rate (LGR) of methane is dependent upon the age of landfill, moisture content, type of refuse, etc. and will vary from landfill to landfill. The landfill gas composition for these types of landfills is approximately 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Area Sources Area sources consist of inactive landfills that had less than 1 million ton of refuse in place. These landfills were closed many years ago and data is very limited. In 1999, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 10% of the total waste in place. In future years, this value will decrease linearly because of less contribution from these area sources. In 2008, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 7.75% of the total waste in place. The assumptions used estimate criteria pollutant (organics) and GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions listed below: The LGR of methane for these closed landfills was 0.030 mcf/year – ton-in-place. The landfill gas composition for area source landfills is similar to point source landfills without collection systems, namely 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. The ROG factor for area source landfills is the same as for point source landfills at 0.0089. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Monthly Variation Estimated daily emissions are assumed to be uniform for all months of the year. This is due to burial/insulation of the refuse that reduces impact of ambient temperature changes, allowing somewhat uniform biodegradation throughout the year. County Distribution Point Source Categories (Cat. Nos. 1157, 1686, and 1687) The data bank system contains information on the county location of each landfill; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. It is assumed San Francisco County has had no landfills within their boundaries; therefore, their refuse is transported to the other counties. Area Source Category (Cat. No. 1158) The county fractions were based in the number of closed landfills (not accounted for by the District) in the in each county. This data was obtained from the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) at CalRecycle’s website (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov). 5.2.2 Trends History &amp; Growth Category Nos. 1157 and 1158’s historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Population growth profile, Percentage of cumulative waste generation attributed to point or area source, Per capita waste generation, and Overall collection efficiency of the landfill gas.

By 1999, it was assumed that 90% of the cumulative waste generation was attributed to point sources, and the remaining 10% was attributed to area sources. By 2030, it is assumed the point source percentage will increase linearly to 97.75% and the area source percentage will decrease linearly to 2.25% Since the State of California passed a mandate (Assembly Bill 939) that required a reduction in waste generation, per capita waste generation in the District has decreased. Until 1990, this factor was approximately 1.32 tons/person/year; in 2008, it had decreased to 0.79 tons/person/yr. By 2030, it is assumed the per capita waste generation in the District will decrease linearly to 0.70 tons/person/year. In addition to what was previously mentioned, Categories Nos. 1686 and 1687 historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Prior to 1984 (the year Reg. 8, Rule 34 was passed), it was assumed all landfill gases were emitted as fugitive emissions. By 1996, the overall collection efficiency at landfills was assumed to be 75%, with 25% of the landfill gases emitted as fugitive emissions. Between those two years, the collection efficiencies were interpolated. Control Currently, Regulation 8, Rule 34 (Solid Waste Disposal Sites) requires that certain landfills process landfill gases through a gas collection and emission control system such that: There are no leaks that exceed 1000 PPM by volume measured as methane at any component or connector of the landfill gas collection system; and The collected gases are process in an enclosed ground type flare with a TOG destruction efficiency of at least 98% by weight; or The collected gases are processed in an energy recovery device or emission control system that reduces the amount of TOG by at 97% by weight.

Greenhouse gas emissions, namely methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were also calculated for this category. Methodology Emissions for this category are calculated by multiplying the annual activity (throughput) value for a particular year by the emission factor in question. The annual activity (throughput) for this category was obtained from the March 2009 report “Bay Area Biosolids Management: Challenges, Opportunities, and Policies.” The amount of biosolids generated in in the Bay Area in 2007 was estimated to be 158,000 dry tons. Approximately 19% of that amount, or 30,020 dry tons, was “land applied” for Land Farming purposes. The Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Total Population growth profile was used to obtain the 2011 throughput value of 31,028 dry tons/year. Table 5.3: Emission factors (lb/ton). category TOG CH4 N2O #52 Land Farming 2.24 0.294 1.2 The emission factor for reactive organic gases (ROG) was obtained from the California Integrated Waste Management Board Contractor’s Report to the Board, “Emissions Testing of Volatile Organic Compounds from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the Sab Joaquin Valley”, October 2007. The ROG emission factor for greenwaste /food scrap composting ranged from 1.3 – 2.6 lbs./ton composted. A mid- point value of 1.95 lbs./ton was used. A ROG factor of 0.8689 was used to calculate the total organic gas (TOG) emission factor. This ROG factor was obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for greenwaste composting. The TOG emissions factor of 2.24 lbs./ton was calculated by dividing the ROG emission factor by the ROG factor. The CH4 emission factor of 0.29 lbs./ton was calculated by subtracting the TOG emission factor by the ROG emission factor. The N2O emission factor of 1.1997 lbs./ton was obtained from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste.

["05-05-waste-mgmt-compost.html", "5.5 Composting", " 5.5 Composting 5.5.1 Emissions Introduction Composting is a biological process where organic materials, such as leaves, grasses, etc., are decomposed by microorganisms to create a nutrient-rich, soil-like material. Composting most often takes place in aerobic conditions, however, under certain conditions, composting can occur under anaerobic conditions. These conditions include compost pile structure and density, particle size, low oxygen supply, moisture content, low oxygen supply, etc. Methane emissions increase under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, proper monitoring and management are very important to maintain aerobic conditions for efficient composting operation. The composting process includes the following steps: Feedstock Preparation, Composting, Curing, Screening, and Storage. In the feedstock preparation step, the composted organic materials are screened and, if required, processed in a grinder to achieve the best composting conditions. This mixture is then placed in rows or piles where the decomposition process begins. The initial phase of composting, lasting for about one month is very active and generates temperatures high enough to kill weed seeds and pathogens. After this “active” phase, the material is cured at a slower rate and temperature. During this phase, the moisture content is reduced and a more stable product is produced. Once the compost is cured, the material is screened to produce the desired product and then stored prior to final distribution and use. Methodology In 2011, there were approximately 32 composting facilities1 in the Bay Area. Ten (12) of these facilities are permitted by the District and considered point sources (Category 1709). The point sources contain annual activity (throughput) information for each applicable source that is stored in the District’s Data Bank. Reactive organic (ROG) emissions are then calculated by using emission factors (generalized or specific) and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. Some related compositing activity (i.e. windrow and storage activities, etc.) are also permitted and particulate emissions are calculated. Note: The composting operations that involve mushroom farming were not included in this count. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse Gas Inventories does not assign mushroom farm media preparation to the waste sector for emission inventory development. It falls under the Industrial Processes and Product Use, Food and Beverage Industry, or Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use, manure Management, Poultry (3A2i). The other approximate 20 facilities are considered area sources (Category 1936) where annual throughput, criteria pollutant emission factors (TOG and ROG), and control activity (if any) are estimated. The TOG and ROG emissions are calculated by multiplying the throughput by the emission factor and, if applicable, the control factor. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), are also associated with composting activity. The CH4 and N2O emissions are calculated similarly to the criteria pollutant emissions mentioned above. The throughput and emissions factors (TOG, ROG, and GHG) estimates were developed based on the following: Throughput Data For those composting facilities not permitted by the District (area sources), throughput data was provided by industry and CalRecycle officials or using CalRecycle’s Solid Waste Information System’s (SWIS’s) database. The throughput information provided in the SWIS database represents maximum allowable throughputs. The actual throughput was estimated to be 60% of the SWIS database value. The units for throughput information should be in tons per year, however, they may appear in other units, such as cubic yards per year (yd3/yr), cubic yards per day (yd3/day), tons per day, etc. For those throughputs that required a conversion factor to tons, the following bulk density values were used: Greenwaste – 3.54 yd3/ton Mixed (greenwaste mixed with food, manure, etc.) – 2.24 yd3/ton The above conversion factors were taken from the California Integrated Management Board (CIWMB) Report, “Third Assessment of California’s Compost and Mulch Producing Infrastructure”, May 2009. For throughputs that were in a volume per day format, it was assumed most facilities operated 260 days per year. However, for some facilities, this value may vary slightly. Emission Factors The Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.85 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 1.95 lbs/ton The emission factors above were cited in the October 2007 CIWMB study, “Emission Testing of VOC from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the San Joaquin Valley.” The mid-point value for each of the emission factors was used. Total Organic Gas (TOG) emission factors were calculated by dividing the ROG emission factors by a ROG factor. A ROG factor, obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD), of 0.8689 was used. The TOG emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.98 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 2.24 lbs/ton Methane (CH4) emission factors were assumed to be the difference between the TOG and ROG emission factors. The CH4 emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.13 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 0.29 lbs/ton The Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emission factors varied from 0.12 to 1.1997 lbs/ton and were obtained from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste. The N2O emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.12 lb/ton Greenwaste, including food – 0.6599 lb/ton Mixed (greenwaste, manure, etc.) – 1.1997 lbs/ton Emission Calculation The TOG, ROG, CH4, and N2O annual emissions for an area source (Category 1936) facility were calculated by multiplying the estimated throughput by the respective pollutant emission factor. Monthly Variation The emissions are assumed to be distributed evenly throughout the year. County Distribution The county distribution was based on the location as found in the District databank or SWIS data mentioned above. 5.5.2 Trends History It was assumed composting in the Bay Area began in the mid-1980’s (1985 was used as the starting point). There was limited information in prior years, so it was assumed throughput activity exhibited a linear decrease from 2005 back to 1985. From 2005 – 2008, the growth was based on the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Total Population growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on the ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Control Currently, there is no District rule regulating emissions from compost facilities. However, there are several facilities in the Bay Area with in-vessel composting where it is assumed there is an overall VOC control efficiency of 90%.

There are numerous intermediate products in a refinery including liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, diesels, and fuel oils. The waste products include wastewater, spent acids, and oily sludge. Categories 55-58 contain point source emissions from refineries tanks, and categories 84- 85 account for point souce emissions from tanks at other sites. Category 940 accounts for point source emissions from cleaning of all storage tanks. Category 1902 and 1903 accounts for area source emissions from storage tanks. Storage tanks at bulk plants and gasoline stations are inventoried in sections 6.4 and 6.9, respectively. Methodologies The categories for storage tanks contain emissions from both point and area sources. Tank emissions are calculated using equations and emission factors from U.S. EPA’s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emisssion Factors, AP-42, Volume I: Station Point and Area Sources. The primary criteria pollutant emitted from storage tanks include hydrocarbon vapors or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The predominant types of storage tanks found in a refinery include: Fix roof tanks External floating roof tanks Internal floating roof tanks Conservation tanks, pressure tanks, and others The types of tank along with the following parameters (given below) are used to calculate emissions. Tank diameter Paint factor Tank height Vapor space Temperature change Tank volume Throughput Stored material Factors specific to stored material Point source emissions are obtained from the District’s data bank system. The data bank contains information submitted by the individual refinery by tank sources. Area Source emissions are derived based on an estimated ratio between area and point source throughputs via tank type. Monthly Variation and County Distribution The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information for each category. 6.1.2 Trends History Historical emissions have varied with refinery throughputs.

This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Control Regulation 8-5 controls emissions from the storage of organic liquids. Control efficiencies are estimated to range from 17% to 96%, depending on the type of tank, percentage of sources with true vapor pressures above 0.5 psi, and average true vapor pressure of the corresponding category.

["06-02-petprod-marine-load.html", "6.2 Refinery and Marine Loading Operations", " 6.2 Refinery and Marine Loading Operations 6.2.1 Emissions Introduction Category 60 includes all refinery loading operations other than tanker and barge loading. This category accounts for emissions mostly from loading racks and railroad/truck tank car loading. The following categories include evaporation emissions due to handling of all organic products at marine loading facilities. Categories 86 and 87 account for evaporation emissions due to the transfer of cargo (organic materials) from larger ships to smaller ships and barges. Lightering is necessary because large ships are unable to navigate the shallow waters of the San Francisco Bay. Since the mid-2000’s, there has been little or no lightering activity in the San Francisco Bay. Categories 88-90 account for evaporation emissions due to ballasting crude oil, gasoline, and other materials, respectively. Ballasting is the process of pumping seawater into petroleum holding tanks to make a vessel more stable. When water is pumped into a tank, the contaminated vapor in the tank is displaced into the atmosphere. Emissions from ballasting are declining because few vessels now calling on Bay Area ports ballast into cargo tanks. Older vessels are being phased out of service in response to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Modern vessels have segregated ballast tanks that are used only for ballast water. There are no organic emissions emitted during ballast operations with segregated ballast tanks. Category 91 accounts for emissions from gas venting. When a tank vessel unloads its product, organic vapors are left in the compartments. Frequently, vessels vent these vapors to the atmosphere for safety reasons. Categories 795-798 account for all evaporative emissions from loading/unloading of gasoline, crude oil and other organic products from marine vessels at the oil refineries. Categories 799-802 account for evaporative emissions from loading/unloading of gasoline and crude oil from all non-refinery operations. Methodologies Area Source Methodologies For Categories 86 and 87, the refineries within the District were surveyed to obtain the throughputs (in 1000 gallons) transferred for a given year. The monthly variations and county distributions were also obtained from these surveys. Emission factors were obtained from ARB’s Emission Inventory Procedural Manual. Since 2005, there has been no lightering activity in the San Francisco Bay. For Categories 88-90, the amount of material transferred was estimated from data found in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 Waterborne Commerce of the United States, Part 4–Waterways and Harbors-Pacific Coast, Alaska and Hawaii. The emission factors, ballasting amounts for the different fuels, etc. were obtained from California Air Resources Board’s Methodology Document on Marine Petroleum Unloading (October 1997). For Category 91, the following assumptions were made: The average tanker delivering crude oil to the Bay Area has a deadweight tonnage of 120,000 tons. This represents a tanker volume of approximately 32.4 million gallons, assuming a density of 7.4 lbs./gal. In 2008, it was estimated a total of 6,867,568 million gallons of crude was unloaded in Bay Area ports. Assuming the above tanker volume, this represents approximately 212 tanker visits. Purging is not done that often at Bay Area ports. In the report, Oil Tanker Purging &amp; Gas Freeing (December 1999), it was estimated purging occurred in connection with 35 – 50 arrivals per year. In 2004, it was estimated there were 12 venting operations per year. Since 2004, most ship operators perform their venting operations outside the District boundaries. The emission factor used in purging applications is the same one developed for ballasting operations for crude oil (0.9 lb. VOC/1000 gal). Although ballasting and purging are different operations, they involve displacement of vapors remaining in the tank after cargo discharge. Point Source Methodologies Categories 60 and 795-802 contain point sources permitted by the District. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies or source test results or general factors, from the AP-42). Emission control factors (device-specific or general). Monthly Variation For the point source categories (Cats. 60, 795-802), the monthly distribution was estimated based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal throughput data. For the area source categories (Cats. 88-91), the monthly distribution was assumed to be uniform throughout the year. County Distribution For the point source categories, the county location of each company, as reported in the Data Bank, is used to distribute emissions into each county. For the area source categories, the county distribution was based on the throughputs of products unloaded at the various Bay Area ports, as reported in the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ 2008 Waterborne Commerce of the United States, Part 4–Waterways and Harbors-Pacific Coast, Alaska and Hawaii. 6.2.2 Trends History Prior years’ growth factors for these categories were based on historical data (i.e. from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Waterborne Commerce reports, the District’s databank, etc.) and energy reports.

Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are the potential leak sources. Categories 61 and 868, account for fugitive organic emissions including methane (CH4) from natural gas distribution system in the San Francisco Bay Area. Emissions from Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&amp;E’s) pipeline system that distributes natural gas for its own use are covered in Category #61. Emissions from PG&amp;E’s pipeline system that distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers are covered in Category #868. Methodology Fugitive emissions occur from leaks in the pipeline distribution system. Prior to 1990, an emission factor of 0.7% by volume of gas distributed was used. This factor was based on the South Coast Air Quality Management District report “Estimated Fugitive Emissions from Natural Gas Transmission for Calendar Year 1979”, July, 1980. Since 1990, an emission factor of 0.2% has been used for both distribution systems: PG&amp;E’s own usage (Category #61) and PG&amp;E’s customers (Category #868). This emission factor is based on the 1990 PG&amp;E report titled “Unaccounted-For Gas Project”. Emission Factors in pounds per thousand cubic feet of gas (lb/MCF) are shown below in Table 6.3.

Temporal Variation The daily, weekly and monthly emission rates are considered to be uniform. 6.3.2 Trends History In general, emissions increase as activity increases and emissions decrease as activity decreases. In recent years, emissions for category #868 have been increasing, while emissions for category #61 have been on the decrease due to PG&amp;E’s divestments in power plants. For Base Year 1983, all natural gas distribution losses were handled as a single category which had been designated as Category #43. The category has been subsequently split into two categories (#61 and #868) since Base Year 1987. For Category #61 up to base year 2008, it was assumed that annual emissions would tend to follow two components: services industry employment and population by county in the District. As such, a hybrid growth profile was developed based on 50% of the appropriate county services industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate county population value in combination with CEC’s natural gas data. For Category #868 up to base year 2008, it was assumed that annual emissions would tend to follow: manufacturing industry employment and population by county in the District in combination with CEC’s natural gas consumption forecasts. As such, a hybrid growth profile was developed based on 50% of the appropriate county manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate county population value in combination with CEC’s natural gas data.

["06-07-petprod-gasoline-truck-transport.html", "6.7 Gasoline Truck Transport", " 6.7 Gasoline Truck Transport 6.7.1 Emissions Introduction Gasoline truck transit losses are similar in many ways to breathing losses associated with petroleum storage. The gasoline is transferred by tank trucks from refineries and bulk plants for delivery to end user outlets. Emissions depend on the vapor tightness of the tank, the pressure relief valve settings, the pressure in the tank at the start of the trip, the vapor pressure of fuel being transported, and the degree of fuel vapor saturation of space in the tank. Methodology This category accounts for the organic emissions occurring in transit while transporting fuel by tank trucks. Emissions from gasoline cargo tanks include the fugitive emissions and emissions from maintenance. The emission points are from pressure-related fugitive (Cat#1600, Cargo Tank) emissions from the cargo tank fittings and valves, vapor hoses (Cat#1601, Loading-Return Vapor Hoses) after loading into the underground tank, and wetted wall emissions from the product (Cat#1602, Loading-Main Hoses). Pressure-related fugitive (Cat#1600, Cargo Tank) emissions are volatile organic vapors leaking from fittings, valves and other connecting points in the vapor collection system on a cargo tank. Pressure inside the cargo tank is caused by solar and reflective heat gains. Due to these heat gains, vapors inside the cargo tank expand and exert pressure to the tank walls, fittings and valves. Emissions from the vapor hose (Cat#1601, Loading-Return Vapor Hoses) are a result of vapors trapped inside the hose after product delivery to the underground tank. Some vapors condense inside the hose. When the hose is disconnected from the underground tank and truck fittings, the vapors and condensed vapor inside the hose are emitted into the ambient air. Emissions from the product hoses (Cat#1602, Loading-Main Hoses) are a result of residual product clinging to the walls of the hoses. Residual liquid, inside the hose, vaporizes into the ambient air resulting in emissions. This methodology is presently based on CARB’s methodology. TOG emission factors are listed below: Pressure-Related (Cat#1600) Losses: 0.588 lbs per 1000 gallons, Vapor Hose (Cat#1601) Losses: 0.024 lbs per 1000 gallons, Product Hose (Cat#1602) Losses: 0.133 lbs per 1000 gallons. The estimates of gasoline consumption in the Bay Area were provided by California State Board of Equalization, Fuel Taxes Statistics &amp; Reports and Caltrans Transportation Planning Support Information System (TPSIS). These estimates were made by adjustments of Gasoline Dispensing Facility sales, population, number of registered vehicles, and the number of drivers’ license.

With the current requirements of the CARB’s Phase II Vapor recovery systems regulations, the GDF categories’ emissions will be greatly reduced for forecasted emission years. Control Emissions were reduced due to the improvement of vapor recovery nozzle in Phase II Gasoline Dispensing Facilities. Regulation 8 rule 7 does not specify emission reduction for this category. However, the improvement of the vapor recovery nozzles reduces spillage at vehicle filling services stations. By: Michael Nguyen Date: January, 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["06-09-petprod-GDF-storage.html", "6.9 Gasoline Filling Station Storage", " 6.9 Gasoline Filling Station Storage 6.9.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities (GDF) are generated when gasoline vapors in the underground storage tank are displaced to the atmosphere by the gasoline being loaded into the tank. The emissions are due to breathing (vapor expansion and contraction of liquid in the tank) and working (from filling and emptying the tanks). Breathing losses occur as a result of dinural temperature and pressure variations. Working losses occur as fueling from underground storage tanks, fresh air is entered into the tank through the vent. Because this entering air is not at equilibrium with the liquid in the tank, evaporation of liquid occurs. Most gasoline dispensing facilities (GDF) in the Bay Area were equipped with Phase I and/or Phase II vapor recovery systems. Phase I vapor recovery system employs a dual hose that recovers gasoline vapor back to the tank truck during the filling of underground tanks. The integral part of Phase II vapor recover system is the vapor recovery nozzle and hose that efficiently collect the displaced vapors. Methodologies These categories account for organic emissions associated with the storage of fuel at gasoline service stations (or GDF). The estimates of gasoline consumption in the Bay Area were provided by California State Board of Equalization, Fuel Taxes Statistics &amp; Reports and Caltrans Transportation Planning Support Information System (TPSIS). These estimates were made by adjustments of Gasoline Dispensing Facility sales, population, number of registered vehicles, and the number of drivers’ license. The throughput for each type of GDF was estimated based on the information contained in the District’s data bank. The 2011 gasoline consumption in the Bay Area was 7,041 thousand gallons per day. Emission factors were taken from AP-42, Section 4.4. The total emissions for area source categories are determined by multiplying the emission factor, control factor and throughput. Monthly variation Monthly variation of emissions was based on gasoline usage data for California. The monthly Bay area gasoline usage was estimated from Board of Equalization Taxable Gasoline Sales monthly report. County Distribution Emissions distributed into the nine counties were based on Caltrans’ Transportation Planning Support Information System’s breakdown. 6.9.2 Trends History Emissions for these categories had been reduced due to Phase I and II vapor balance system requirements since 1975. Prior to 1990 Base Year, taxable gasoline sales for California obtained from the Board of Equalization were assumed to distribute to all gasoline filling stations in the California. ARB estimated that Bay Area consumed 20.01% of this state total. The emissions for this category were determined according to this estimated throughput.

["06-11-petprod-GDF-excess.html", "6.11 Gasoline Filling Station - Excess Emissions", " 6.11 Gasoline Filling Station - Excess Emissions 6.11.1 Emissions Introduction This category accounts for excess emissions from gasoline dispensing nozzles at gasoline service stations. The excess emissions are comprised of spitback, pseudo-spillage, low air to liquid ratio, pressure-related fugitive emissions, idle-nozzle emissions occurring after a refueling using Emco Wheaton A4001 nozzles and “whoosh” emissions. Spitback, pseudo-spillage, low air to liquid ratio, and pressure-related fugitives excess emissions apply only to Phase II vapor recovery systems using “bootless” nozzles. Idle nozzle emissions apply to refueling events using Emco Wheato n A4001 balance-type nozzles. “Whoosh” emissions are from all vehicle fuel tanks. In 1995, 352 gasoline service stations were equipped with vacuum-assist Phase II vapor recovery systems utilizing bootless nozzles. The bootless nozzle design typically, but not always, uses a coaxial spout design. Product flows through the inner tube, while a vacuum pump draws the vapors through the outer portion of the coaxial spout. The primary marketing advantage of the bootless nozzle is that it does not require the bellows necessary on balance-type nozzles. The recovered vapors are then sent back to underground storage tank under a slight pressure. Because of excess dispensing rates, and certain design issues, the initial bootless nozzles were more prone to spitback and spillage. Excess emissions Spitback Spillage Spitback is the forcible ejection of gasoline from the fillpipe, upon activation of the nozzle’s primary shutoff mechanism, at the end of a fueling event. When gasoline dispensing rate is greater than ten gallons per minute (10 gpm), the nozzle’s primary shutoff mechanism fails to adequately cease dispensing. Normally the bellows on a balance-type nozzle redirects spitback into the motor vehicle’s fillpipe. In the case of bootless nozzles, liquid gasoline leaves the fillpipe and spills on both the vehicle and ground. Two of the “bootless” vacuum-assist Phase II systems were certified at dispensing rates over 10 gpm, the Gilbarco VaporVac (13.0 gpm) and the Hasstech (12.0 gpm). In addition, based on confusion within the industry, many of the Dresser/Wayne WayneVac bootless systems were also installed and operated at dispensing rates well in excess of 10 gpm. Pseudo-Spillage Pseudo spillage in bootless nozzle is from the liquid gasoline retained in the (a) product side of the nozzle, (b) vapor passage of the nozzle, (c) primary shutoff chamber of the nozzle, and (d) vapor passage of the coaxial hose. This liquid is on the atmosphere side of any check valves and it either evaporates between refueling events, or is spilled as the next customer attempt to insert the nozzle into the fillpipe. Balance type nozzles are required to possess a mechanism that prevents the nozzle from dispensing gasoline unless the bellows is compressed. This device prevents prefueling spillage caused by inadvertently depressing the nozzle trigger prior to insertion into the vehicle fillpipe. Many of the bootless nozzles will “spit” gasoline if the trigger is depressed. It is important that a nozzle be securely latched onto the lip of the fillpipe to prevent the nozzle from falling out during a refueling event. Commonly used bootless nozzles use a spout spring to serve this function. This specific spring, however, does not make a secure connection to the fillpipe in most vehicles. Since the nozzles used do not possess an attitude shutoff design, if the nozzle falls out of the fillpipe, it will continue to dispense gasoline until it hits the ground and in some instances will continue to dispense gasoline until the nozzle or dispenser is deactivated. Low Air to Liquid (A/L) Ratio Excess emissions caused by low collection efficiencies due to inadequate air to liquid (A/L) ratios occur at bootless nozzles systems. The BAAQMD’s testing of over 1,200 refueling gasoline service stations equipped with the WayneVac vacuum assist systems showed an average A/L of 0.77. Low A/L ratios reduce the ability of the system to adequately collect vapors from the vehicle fuel tank. Assuming a linear relationship between A/L and collection efficiency, and collection efficiency of 96% at A/L of 1.00, the collection efficiency at 0.77 A/L can be calculated as 96% x 0.77 = 73.9%. Therefore, the excess emission factor is: \\[ (8.4\\ lb/1000\\ gal)(96\\% - 73.9\\%) = 1.85\\ lb/1000\\ gal \\] Pressure-Related Fugitives Many of the defects causing the low A/L ratio at the bootless nozzle system that allows ambient air to be ingested into the underground storage tanks. This air evaporates liquid gasoline, creating an increase in the storage tank headspace pressure. Excess headspace pressure in the storage tank results in excess pressure-related fugitive emissions. Idle Nozzle Emissions BAAQMD source test data shows that the Emco Wheaton A4001 nozzles emit more than other balance system nozzles. The vapor check valve in the Emco Wheaton A4001 nozzle is located between the hose and the dispenser, instead of being an integral part of the nozzle. Therefore, a portion of the condensed gasoline left in the hose after each refueling event evaporates and is emitted via the nozzle. Due to thermal considerations, emissions are greatest during the summer months. Whoosh Emissions “Whoosh” emissions are the emissions released when the gasoline cap on the vehicle tank is removed for fueling. Table I shows the 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2011 estimated emissions along with 1995 gasoline throughput and emission factors used for each category. FIXME: INSERT TABLE Total gasoline consumption in the Bay Area was obtained from Caltrans. The 1995 calendar year gasoline consumption was 2,915,034 thousand gallons, or 7,986 thousand gallons per day. Assumptions This category accounts for only the excess emissions resulting from the use of bootless nozzles at gasoline dispensing facilities (GDF), idle-nozzle emissions occurring after refueling, and “Whoosh” emissions. Forty percent of the daily gasoline was pumped through bootless nozzles. Five percent of the vehicles were subjected to the excess spitback spillage. Therefore, \\[ \\text{Throughput} = (7,986\\text{ thousand gallons})(40\\%)(5\\%) = 160\\text{ thousand gallons} \\] The emission factor for excess spitback caused by high dispensing rates was estimated to be 19.7 lbs/1,000 gallons based on bootless nozzle tests conducted by District Source Test Engineers. All bootless nozzles were subjected to this loss; therefore, throughput is 40% of the gasoline consumption. The emission factor for Pseudo-spillage was estimated to be 0.75 lbs/1000 gallons based on bootless nozzle tests conducted by District Source Test Engineers. Fifty percent of bootless nozzles were equipped with the WayneVac system which showed low A/L ratios. \\[ \\text{Throughput} = (7,986\\text{ thousand gallons})(40\\%)(50\\%) = 1,597\\text{ thousand gallons} \\] Emission factor for Low Air to Liquid Ratios was obtained from the results of several bootless nozzle tests conducted by District Source Test Engineers. All bootless nozzles were subjected to this loss; therefore, throughput is 40% of the gasoline consumption. The emission factor for Pressure-Related Fugitives was estimated to be 3.97 lbs/1000 gallons based on the results of several tests conducted by District Source Test Engineers. 20.97% of the nozzles in the Bay Area is Emco Wheaton (EW) A4001 nozzles having excess idle-nozzle emissions. Therefore, \\[ \\text{Throughput} = (7,986\\text{ thousand gallons})(20.97\\%) = 1,675\\text{ thousand gallons} \\] The refueling uncontrolled emission factor is 8.4 lbs/1000 gallons. Since 95% is controlled, 5% emissions are already accounted for in other categories. The excess idle nozzle emission factor is based on the assumption that EW 4001 nozzles emit 20% greater emissions than other nozzles, as stated in Toxics Committee of California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA), December 1997 report. Therefore, the EW 4001 idle nozzle emission factor is: \\[ \\text{Emission Factor} = (8.4 \\text{lbs/1000 gallons})(95\\%)(20\\%) = 1.60\\text{ lbs/1000 gallons} \\] Emission factors for “whoosh” emissions were obtained from “Gasoline Service Station Industrywide Risk Assessment Guidelines” prepared by the Toxics Committee of the California Air Pollution Control Officers Association (CAPCOA), December 1997. This throughput for “whoosh” emissions applies to total gasoline consumption in the Bay Area. It must be noted that several designs of Onboard Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR) vehicles greatly reduce the emissions from this category. Steps taken to Control Excess Emissions Spitback Spillage Because the US EPA requirement to limit dispensing rates (10 gallons per minute or less), effective July 1, 1996 all of the excess emissions due to spitback emissions have been eliminated. Aggressive enforcement, including measuring dispensing rates, will ensure compliance. Pseudo-Spillage Bay Area AQMD developed an inspection procedure, GDF-IP-04, to quantify these emissions on a per nozzle basis and limit pseudo-spillage to 3 drops per minute. Regulation 8, Rule 7 was amended to limit pseudo-spillage on all new installations. It is estimated that 95 percent of these excess emissions will be reduced by 2003. 6.11.1.0.1 Low Air to Liquid (A/L) Ratios The emissions caused by low A/L occur both as reduced collection efficiency during the refueling event and increased pressure-related emissions caused by air ingestion through leaks in nozzles not being used during the refueling activity. The Bay Area has worked closely with CARB to have one dispenser manufacturer require retrofitting systems which had liquid traps in the vapor piping to eliminate this problem. All new and rebuilt nozzles are also now equipped with the improved spouts. The Bay Area AQMD also imposed an Abatement Order on Shell, the company which has the largest population of bootless systems. As a result, A/L tests are being conducted quarterly and equipment checks, including the “Bag Test” developed by the Bay Area AQMD are required to be conducted monthly. It is estimated that 95 percent of these excess emissions will be reduced by 2003. Pressure-Related Fugitives The Bay Area developed two additional inspection procedures: a simple visual inspection procedure for both the affected industry and local inspectors to detect vapor leaks in the Phase I equipment, and an inspection procedure to determine compliance with the pressure integrity performance specification (0.38 CFH @ 2.0 inches water column) for drop tube based overfill protection. These changes improve the performance of Phase I equipment in service stations, and maintain the integrity of the systems between tests. It is estimated that 50 percent of these excess emissions will be reduced by 2003. California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted a series of new Enhanced Vapor Recovery (EVR) amendments to its gas station vapor recovery regulations (Phase I and Phase II) in March 2000. The adopted amendments also include mandatory In- Station-Diagnostics (ISD), which are requiring electronic monitoring of vapor recovery system operation and performance. The certification requirement of In- Station-Diagnostics is expected to be fully implemented by April 2004. However, emission reductions will be gradual and take longer. The pressure-related fugitive emissions will be reduced 80 percent by 2006. Idle Nozzle Emissions A revision to Regulation 8, Rule 7 disallowed the use of balance nozzles without an integral vapor valve (i.e. the Emco-Wheaton A4001 nozzles). It is estimated that 95 percent of these excess emissions will be reduced by 2003. Whoosh Emissions Some onboard refueling vapor recovery (ORVR) systems in post 2000 cars have a design which minimizes the pressure-related vehicle tank headspace losses when the fill cap is removed. It is estimated that 80 percent of these excess emissions will be reduced by 2006. ARB Actions In March 2000, California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted a series of new Enhanced Vapor Recovery (EVR) amendments to its gas station vapor recovery regulations (Phase I and Phase II). In addition, CARB adopted new standards: to make vapor recovery system compatible with on-board vapor recovery (ORVR) systems on motor vehicles, to reduce gasoline spillage, liquid retain in the nozzles, and to pressure-related fugitive emissions. The adopted amendments also include mandatory In-Station-Diagnostics (ISD), which are requiring electronic monitoring of vapor recovery system operation and performance.

["06-12-petprod-portable_spillage.html", "6.12 Portable Fuel Container Spillage", " 6.12 Portable Fuel Container Spillage 6.12.1 Emissions Introduction Portable fuel containers or “Gas cans”, and gas can spouts are used to refuel off-road engines and equipment (i.e. lawnmowers, chainsaws, motorcycles, etc.). Portable fuel containers are made of either plastic or metal in variety shapes and sizes ranging from one to more than six gallons capacity. Portable fuel containers are designed for transportation, storing and dispensing fuel. The California Air Resource Board (CARB) regulates all portable fuel containers manufactured for sale and use in 2000. The regulations are intended to reduce refueling emissions from equipment and engines in the off-road categories that are predominantly refueled with portable fuel containers. The Mobile Source Control Division (MSCD) of CARB conducted surveys to establish the number of statewide portable fuel container population in 1998. These surveys show that there are 9,878,706 portable fuel container units statewide. The data also indicate that 94% of portable fuel containers are used in residential households, and 6% for commercial use. Therefore, the effect of the statewide regulations on commercial users (i.e., tree trimming services, landscape maintenance professionals, automobile tow services, etc.) would be insignificant. Using total container population and an average useful life of 5 years suggested by several manufacturers, ARB estimates the total sales of all portable fuel containers statewide. 6.12.1.1 Methodology {- petprod-portable_spillage-methodology} This category accounts for evaporative emissions resulting in spillage from refueling, transport and storage of the portable fuel containers. These portable containers contribute emissions by: permeation of vapors through walls in containers made from plastic; escaping fumes while fuel is being poured into equipment; spillage and/or over-filling as fuel is being poured into equipment; spillage and evaporation through secondary vent holes; and evaporation through inadequately capped spouts. CARB estimates 3.57 tons of uncontrolled ROG emissions per day statewide from portable fuel containers in 2011. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions was based on the monthly California taxable gasoline data from the Board of Equalization. County Distribution County household population from ABAG’s 2009 Projections was used to distribute emissions for each county. 6.12.2 Trends History The MSCD survey indicated that 1,975,741 units of residential and commercial portable fuel container were sold in 1998. Assumed 20 percent of these units are sold in the Bay Area. This figure was derived from Bay Area household population compared to statewide data. CARB has grouped the various sizes of portable fuel containers into three categories as shown in Table 6.15 below. Table 6.15: Portable fuel containers.

This regulation required all portable containers and spouts to have an automatic shut-off feature to prevent overfilling of power equipment fuel tanks. The spouts should also have an automatic closing feature so the portable fuel container would be sealed when not in use. This gas can regulation prevented spills during equipment fueling and evaporation during fuel storage. CARB estimated an overall reduction of 3 tons per day (approximately 30 percent compared to previous estimates) in ROG emissions if this regulation was fully implemented by 2005.

Over-the- wing and single point pressure fueling are two systems used by airports for refueling aircraft. The over-the-wing is similar to a service station without a vapor recovery system. Single point pressure systems use pressure and a closed connection to refuel aircraft. The gasoline vapors in the aircraft tank are vented into the atmosphere through vents on the wings. Other sources of emissions for these categories are also from working and breathing of the underground storage tank during refueling. Methodologies The amount of aviation and jet fuel usage from San Jose International Airport and Oakland International Airport were obtained from the airport’s Monthly Activity Report. The fuel usage at the other airports was determined by apportioning the Oakland Airport usage with the number of operations. The uncontrolled emission factors of gasoline service station are used for refueling with gasoline over-the-wing. The emission factors are chosen based on EPA, AP-42 publication and engineering judgment.

Emissions result from vapor displacement to the atmosphere. Methodology Fuel usage from Ships and Tugboats were estimated based on the number of ships data provided by the San Francisco Marine Exchange (see also Ships Categories). It was assumed that about 30 % of the fuel used by ships and tugboats were pumped in the Bay Area. Emission factors for gasoline station are used to calculate emissions. Fuel usage from Ferry boats were obtained from the major ferry and cruise operators in the Bay - i.e. the Golden Gate Bridge District (Ferry Division), Blue and Gold, and Red and White Fleet (see also Ferry Boats Category). Of the total registered boats, it was assumed that 75% were used for fishing activities. It was assumed further that an average of 4 hours was used per trip. Fuel rate was estimated at 5.24 gal per hour for an average engine size of 140 HP engine at 80% power load. Fuel usage was estimated based on this for the Fishing boats category. For recreational boats, the amount of fuel usage was estimated based on a KVB Study on gasoline use tax, the number of boats per DMV registration. Total organics emissions are determined by multiplying the estimated fuel usage in each of the category activity and the emission factor.

Methodologies The ARB estimated alternative fuel usage as 8% by on-road vehicles, 10% by other internal combustion engines, 8% by farm equipment, and 74% by residential/commercial sources. About 18% of the total state usage, or approximately 94,814 thousand gallons (propane), came from the Bay Area. The emission factor used was based on fuel tests by the Western Propane Gas Association which showed an average of about 0.263 grams of total hydrocarbon per liter of fuel. This converts to about 2.193 lbs. of total organics per thousand gallons of fuel. Monthly Variation Since activities on this category are heavily during recreational use, monthly variation was estimated similar to the recreational boats category, with the highest usage during the summer months.

Ethylene Oxide is widely used due to its ability to kill microbes in difficult to reach places. Category 92 and 1577 account for point and area sources from medical sterilizers in the Bay Area, respectively. Methodology Point Source Category 92 contains point source emission data reported to the District’s permitting department. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the companies Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may supplied by companies also) The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. The point source emissions at present are less than 0.01 tons/day of reactive organics. Area Source Category 1577 accounts for non-permitted ethylene oxide emission sources. In 1987, about 206,000 pounds of ethylene oxide was estimated as area source emissions. Because most of these sources are now permitted sources due to Regulation 11 Rule 9, the amount of area source emissions is estimated to have dropped to 1050 pounds of sterilizer gas. Emission factor used for ethylene oxide is one. Therefore, all of the ethylene oxide used is emitted as organic emissions. 6.16.2 Trends History Actual emissions from the District’s permitted sources were used for historical years.

["06-17-petprod-asphalt-pave.html", "6.17 Asphalt Paving", " 6.17 Asphalt Paving 6.17.1 Emissions Introduction Road Oils (Slow-cure Liquid Asphalt), Hot Mix Asphalt, and Emulsified Asphalt, Categories 95 – 97, respectively, account for the organic emissions from asphalt paving materials during and after the paving of roads, streets, and parking lots in the Bay Area. Rapid-cure Liquid Asphalt (Rapid-cure Cutback Asphalt) is no longer used in the Bay Area. Rapid-cure Liquid Asphalt was formerly Category 94. Medium-cure Liquid Asphalt (Medium-cure Cutback Asphalt) may be used in the Bay Area provided the atmospheric temperature does not exceed 500F for 24 hours after application (per BAAQMD Regulation 8-15, Sections 302 and 112.) This restriction greatly limits the application of this type asphalt; therefore, the organic emissions from Medium-cure Liquid Asphalt are considered negligible. Slow-cure Liquid Asphalt (Slow-cure Cutback Asphalt) may also be used in the Bay Area with restrictions (per BAAQMD Regulation 8-15, Section 304). Slow-cure Liquid Asphalt is synonymous with “Road Oils” (Category 95). Methodology The organic emission from asphalt paving operations in the Bay Area was based on ARB’s methodology for emission calculations (Attachment C: Asphalt Paving and Roofing, from STI’s Area Source Emissions Updates, March 2003). In 2011, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Office of Oil and Gas reported 10,589,000 barrels of asphalt were used in California for paving and roofing purposes. Of that amount, it was assumed 80% (8,471,200 barrels) of the asphalt was used for road paving and 20% (2,117,800 barrels) was used for roofing. (To calculate asphalt usage in tons per year it was assumed an asphalt density of 8 lbs/gal and a barrel equivalent to 42 gals.) Additionally, the statewide asphalt use for paving applications was estimated as follows: Hot-mix: 88% Emulsified: 9% Road Oils: 2% Cutback: &lt;1% (Note: It is assumed some districts, including the BAAQMD, do not use Rapid-cure Cutback Asphalt.) County throughputs can be apportioned from the state’s total using the miles of paved roads in each of the counties. This data was acquired from the States’ Teale Data Center. The organic emission factors used for hot-mix, emulsified, and road oils were 0.04, 17.9, and 2.19 lb/ton of asphalt applied, respectively. (Note—the initial emission factor used for road oils was 88 lbs./ton. This was an EPA recommended value; however, regulatory controls reduced this value to the level stated above.) The total emissions for area source categories are determined by multiplying the emission factor, throughput, and rule effectiveness factor, if applicable.

["06-18-petprod-asphalt-roof.html", "6.18 Asphalt Roofing", " 6.18 Asphalt Roofing 6.18.1 Emissions Introduction Asphalt is used to adhere, repair, and/or create a smooth finish over manufactured roofing materials (i.e. cap sheets, felt sheets and flashing squares) on commercial and industrial buildings and multiple unit dwellings. This category estimates organic emissions from roofing operations; however, it does not include the manufacture of roofing materials, nor does it cover emissions from fuel combustion. The organic emission from asphalt roofing operations in the Bay Area was based on ARB’s methodology for emission calculations (Attachment C: Asphalt Paving and Roofing, from STI’s Area Source Emissions Updates, March 2003). Methodology In 2011, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Office of Oil and Gas reported 13,703,000 barrels of asphalt were used in California for paving and roofing purposes. Of that amount, it was assumed 80% (8,471,200 barrels) of the asphalt was used for road paving and 20% (2,117,800 barrels) was used for roofing. Individual county throughputs can be apportioned from construction activity that was provided to ARB. (For the Bay Area, the fractional total to the state was approximately 0.2573.) The 2011 throughput for the BAAQMD was 544,836 bbls/yr (or 95,423 tons/yr, assuming density of asphalt at 8.34 lb/gal).

["06-19-petprod-clean-solvent.html", "6.19 Solvent Cleaning Operations", " 6.19 Solvent Cleaning Operations 6.19.1 Emissions Introduction The categories reported here are organic emissions resulting from the uses of solvent in Cold Cleaning, Vapor Degreasing, and Other Hand Wiping operations. Cold Cleaning operations consist of both point (Category 1241) and area (Category 1934) source emissions; Category 1243 consists only of point source emissions from Vapor Degreasing operations; and Other Hand Wiping activities both point (Category 1245) and area (Category 1934 1935) source emissions. Category 1243 also has greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from perfluorocarbon usage in the vapor degreasers. Cold Cleaners The two basic types of cold cleaners are maintenance cleaners and manufacturing cleaners. The maintenance cold cleaners are usually simpler, less expensive and smaller. They are designed principally for automotive and general plant maintenance cleaning. Solvents used in maintenance cleaners are mainly aliphatic petroleum solvents such as mineral spirits and Stoddard solvents. Manufacturing cold cleaners usually perform a higher quality of cleaning than maintenance cleaners and are therefore more specialized. Manufacturing cold cleaning is generally used in metalworking production. A wide variety of solvents are used in this type of cold cleaner. Manufacturing cold cleaners are fewer in number than maintenance cleaners, but tend to emit more solvent per unit because of the larger size and workload. Cold cleaning operations include spraying, brushing, flushing and immersion. The designs for material handling in cold cleaning systems are generally divided into manual and batch loaded conveyorized systems. Manual loading is used for the simple, small- scale cleaning operations while batch loaded conveyorized systems are used for the more complex, larger-scale cleaning operations. Vapor Degreasers Vapor degreasers clean through the condensation of hot solvent vapor on colder parts. Solvent vapors condense on the parts to be cleaned until the temperature of the parts approaches the boiling point of the solvent. The condensing solvent dissolves the oils and provides the washing action. There are two types of vapor degreasers, open top and conveyorized. Open top degreasers are batch loaded (cleaning only one load at a time) and are normally located near the work that is to be cleaned. Conveyorized solvent degreasers generally are located at central cleaning stations, which require transport of parts for cleaning. A typical vapor degreaser is a tank designed to produce and contain solvent vapor. At least one section of the tank is equipped with a heating element that uses steam, electricity, or fuel combustion to boil the solvent. As the solvent boils, dense solvent vapors displace the air within the equipment. Condenser coils located on the sidewalls of the degreaser control the upper level of this pure vapor. These coils (which are supplied with a coolant such as water) are generally located around the inner surface of the degreaser and must be placed below the top edge of the degreaser. This is to protect the solvent vapor zone from disturbance caused by air movement around the equipment. The distance from the top of the vapor zone to the top of the degreaser tank is called the freeboard and is generally established by the location of the condenser coils. The freeboard is 50% – 60% of the width of the degreaser for solvents with higher boiling points (perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane). The freeboard is at least 75% of the width of the degreaser for solvents with lower boiling points (trichlorotrifluoroethane and ethylene chloride). Most degreasers are equipped with a water separator. The condensed solvent and moisture are collected in a trough below the condenser coils and directed to the water separator. The water separator is a simple container, which allows the water to separate and decant from the system while the solvent flows from the bottom of the chamber back into the vapor degreaser. Hand Wiping Hand wiping, or wipe cleaning, includes solvent cleaning done by hand or by means of equipment other than cold cleaners or vapor degreasers. Emissions from hand wiping activities are widespread and occur from solvent usage in manufacturing and maintenance activities. Manufacturing usage refers to any activity (other than in cold cleaners or vapor degreasers) where solvent is used to clean products during the manufacturing process. This includes final wipe cleaning prior to packaging and shipping. Maintenance usage refers to any activity (other than in cold cleaners or vapor degreasers) where solvent is used to clean machinery, tools or other equipment not incorporated into the product. To illustrate this, hand wiping may involve wipe-cleaning a small electronic component with alcohol or large manufacturing equipment with a solvent. Methodologies Cold Cleaners Emissions from the Cold Cleaning Category (Categories 1241 and 1934) were estimated using the District’s July 1998 “Staff Report on Solvent Cleaning Operations for Regulation 8, Rule 16.” In this report, the 1996 cold cleaning emissions were estimated with the assumption that this represented approximately 65% of the total emissions from solvent cleaning operations (including conveyorized). The remaining 35% of the total emissions came from vapor degreasers. A particular base year’s emissions from cold cleaners were based on these 1996 figures and adjusted using growth factors and control factors (discussed under Growth Profile and Control sections). Cold cleaning consist of both point (Category 1241) and area (Category 1934) source emissions. Point sources are covered under the District’s permit system. Emissions are calculated by using solvent throughput of each source reported by companies in the District’s Data Bank system. Emission factors were based on solvent composition. Cold cleaning area source emissions were calculated by subtracting their respective total emissions from their respective point source emissions. As mentioned previously, the total emissions from cold cleaning and vapor degreasing operations were estimated from the District’s staff report. Vapor Degreasers According to District Permit personnel, all vapor degreasers operating within the District can be considered to be point sources (Category 1243). Therefore, organic and GHG emissions are calculated by using specific emission factors (based on solvent composition) and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor developed by district staff engineer will be used to determine emissions. The company also reports solvent throughput of each source. Other Hand Wiping The total District hand wiping emissions were based on the 1996 California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) report on “Solvent Cleaning/Degreasing Source Category Emission Inventory”. One aspect of this report dealt with hand wiping emissions in each air basin within California for 1993. A particular base year’s emissions from hand wiping were based on this 1993 value and adjusted using a growth and control factor (discussed under the Growth Profile and Control sections). Additionally, there are hand wiping emissions that can be found in other District categories (both point and area sources). Since these sources are subject to various other rules (i.e. graphic printing operations, polyester resin operations, various industrial/commercial coatings rules, etc.), the emissions will remain in these specific categories. To prevent “double-counting”, the organic emissions from these categories will be subtracted from the growth adjusted CARB total hand wiping value. This new emission value is known as Other (or remaining) Hand Wiping emissions. Listed below are the categories that contain hand wiping emissions to be subtracted from the total value: Table 6.23: Hand wiping emissions to be subtracted from the total value.

Other Hand Wiping emissions consist of both point (Category 1241) and area (1935) source emissions. Point source emissions are covered under the District’s permit system. Area source emissions were estimated by subtracting the Other (or remaining) Hand Wiping emissions from the point source emissions. Monthly Variation The monthly distribution was estimated based on the point source’s weighted average of reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. County Distribution For point sources, the data bank system contains information on the county location of each facility; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. For area sources, emissions distributed into the nine Bay Area counties are based on the county fractions as determined from CARB’s report on “Solvent Cleaning/Degreasing Source Category Emission Inventory”. 6.19.2 Trends History The growth profiles for the Cold Cleaning, Vapor Degreasing, and Other Hand Wiping categories all followed the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 Manufacturing Employment profile for the years prior to 1993. Between the years 1993 – 2011, the growth profiles were modified to reflect the estimated emissions (point and area source) calculated for those years.

For Vapor Degreasers (Cat. 1243), a decrease in solvent usage from the mid-1990’s has been observed. Using this trend, a conservative estimate of 1.0%/year decrease in throughput activity was assumed. Control District Regulation 8, Rule 16 (for Solvent Cleaning Operations) set operating and equipment standards for cold cleaners and vapor degreasers. In Reg. 8, Rule 16, hand wiping activity was only subject to the Monitoring and Records section. (However, hand wiping may be subjected to other Regulation 8 rules.) Originally adopted in 1979, there have been several amendments to this rule, with the latest being October 2002. It is estimated the current overall control efficiency for cold cleaners is approximately 68%. For vapor degreasers, the overall control efficiency is currently estimated at 81%. An amendment to Regulation 8, Rule 4 (adopted October 16, 2002 and effective June 1, 2003) placed VOC limits on solvent usage in surface preparation (hand wiping) activities to 50 g/l unless controlled to an approved abatement device with an overall control efficiency of at least 85%.

["06-20-petprod-clean-dry.html", "6.20 Dry Cleaning", " 6.20 Dry Cleaning 6.20.1 Emissions Introduction In the dry cleaning process, washing is conducted by agitating the fabric in a solvent bath. The next step is extraction where excess solvent is removed by centrifugal force. In the final step, drying is conducted by tumbling the fabric in a stream of warm air to vaporize and remove the solvent from the fabric. When the washing and extraction steps are performed in one machine and drying in a second machine, it is referred to as a transfer operation. When one machine performs all three steps, it is referred to as a dry- to-dry operation. Coin-operated dry cleaning machines, which are directly available for use by the consumer, typically involve dry-to-dry operations. These dry cleaning facilities emit organic emissions resulting from the use of solvent in cleaning process. The organic emissions may either be reactive (i.e. Stoddard solvent) or nob-reactive (i.e. perchloroethylene). The amount of emission depends on the equipment type, amount of cleaning performed and operating practices. Dry cleaning equipment includes washers, dryers, solvent stills, muck cookers, still residues, and filter muck storage areas. Emissions may also come from leaks from pipes, flanges and pumps. The most common dry cleaning synthetic solvent in use today is perchloroethylene, or PERC, a non-reactive organic material, but considered toxic (Category Nos. 105 and 1912). However, PERC usage in dry cleaning operations will be phased out by the year 2023. Category Nos. 105 and 1912 represent PERC usage in point and area sources, respectively. Other than PERC, there are currently no other halogenated solvents (Category #106) used in the District. The other cleaning solvents used are the non-halogenated petroleum solvents (Category Nos. 107 and 1913). These include both reactive solvents (i.e. Stoddard Solvent, DF- 2000, etc.) and non-reactive solvents (i.e. siloxane). Category Nos. 107 and 1913 represent non-halogenated petroleum solvents usage in point and area sources, respectively. Methodologies Most of the dry cleaning facilities in the Bay Area are covered under the District’s Permit system. Emissions are calculated by using solvent throughput information of each source reported by individual companies in the District’s Data Bank system, called point sources. Emission factors used were based on tests and other data publication. Those dry cleaning facilities not covered under the District’s Permit system are considered area sources. For Category 1912, the area source emissions are assumed to be 10% of the point source emissions. In 2012, most dry cleaning facilities using non-halogenated petroleum solvents were re- classified as registered sources in the District’s Data Bank. As a registered source, a facility must use 100 gallons, per year, or less, of non-halogenated petroleum solvent material. These registered sources are now classified as area sources (Category 1913). (An additional 5% of the number of registered dry cleaners will be added to include those dry cleaning facilities that did not report to the District.) Those dry cleaning facilities using greater than 100 gallons per year of non-halogenated petroleum solvents are considered point sources. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on each facility’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. County Distribution The county location of each facility reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county for Categories 105 and 107. The county fractions for these two categories were also used to their respective area source portions, namely Categories 1912 and 1913. 6.20.2 Trends History Prior years’ emissions were estimated using the Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Population growth profile. This growth profile was modified to reflect the emissions data between the years 1987 – 2011.

In March 2008, amendments to District Regulation 11, Rule 16 (Rule 11-16) phases out all PERC usage in dry cleaning operations by 2023. The cumulative PERC reduction (listed below) was used in developing the growth profile for Categories 105 and 1912 that represents this phase out: Table 6.26: Cumulative PERC reductions.

As mentioned previously, most dry cleaning facilities using non-halogenated petroleum solvents were re-classified as registered sources (i.e. area sources) and thus reflected in the growth profiles for Categories 107 and 1913. After 2012, the growth profiles for these two categories were based on data from a 2009 BAAQMD staff report on dry cleaner emissions projections (Figure IV-A1 of the January 2009 Staff Report for Reg. 2, Rule 1, Reg. 8, Rules 17 and 27, and Reg. 11, Rule 16) and ABAG’s Population growth profile. Control The District originally adopted District Regulation 8-27, for Synthetic Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations as an ozone control measure in May 1980. This rule was amended in March 1982, November 1984, and September 1990 with additional operating requirements. In 1994, the District adopted Regulation 11-16 to incorporate new regulatory standards adopted at the state and federal levels. Regulation 11-16, with its new solvent standards and control requirements, replaced Regulation 8-27. Regulation 8-27 was retained as part of the District’s regulations for State Implementation Plan (SIP) considerations, however, in March 2009 was deleted. District Regulation 11-16 (Perchloroethylene and Synthetic Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations), passed in December 1994 required more stringent requirements on controls, monitoring, ventilation, secondary controls, and certain prohibition of usage of certain machines. In March 2009, Regulation 11-16 was amended to incorporate into the District rule a state law phase out schedule that would eliminate the use of Perchloroethylene in dry cleaning by January 1, 2023. District Regulation 8-17, adopted in May 1980, set operating and emission control requirements to dry cleaning operations using petroleum solvents. In March 1985 and September 1990, this rule was amended to reflect additional control and operating requirements. Some of the newer alternative technologies currently available include some non-halogenated photochemical organic compounds (POC) and non- photochemical organic compounds (NPOC). To reflect the expanded applicability of this rule and update the equipment standards and control requirements, Regulation 8-17 was amended again in March 2009. The title of this rule was also changed from “Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations” to “Non-halogenated Dry Cleaning Operations”. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["06-21-petprod-printing.html", "6.21 Printing", " 6.21 Printing 6.21.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from these categories are from graphic arts printing operations. The graphic arts printing operation uses a variety of inks, materials, coatings, fountain solutions, blanket washes, makeup solvent, solubilizers, and clean-up materials. Organic compounds are contained in these products and are emitted into the atmosphere during the printing operations. Graphic arts printing consists of five primary types of printing operations: Gravure, Flexographic, Letterpress, Lithographic, and Screen. Of the five types of operations, only four major types of printing processes are involved: gravure, letterpress, lithographic, and screen (flexographic printing is simply a modified form of letterpress). These printing processes are briefly described below. Gravure Printing (Cat # 108) – a type of printing operation whereby ink is transferred from a plated minute etched well to a substrate that is supported by an impression roller. Ink excess is removed by a doctor blade; Flexographic Printing (Cat # 109) – a printing operation that utilizes a “rolling technique” to apply words, designs, and pictures to the substrate. The image carrier is made of either a rubber elastomer or a similarly related elastomeric material; Letterpress Printing (Cat # 110) - a printing operation whereby ink is transferred to the paper via an image surface. The image area is raised relative to the non- image area; Lithographic Printing (Cat # 112 - Point Sources, and Cat #1898 - Area Sources) – a printing operation whereby printing of image and non-image areas are carried out on the same plane; Screen Printing (Cat # 115 - Point Sources, and Cat #1899 - Area Sources) – a printing operation whereby printing ink passes to a web or a fabric from which a refined form of stencil is applied. In this emission inventory, the District also accounts for small in housing printing emissions (Cat 116 - Point Sources, and Cat #1900 - Area Sources). Small in house emissions is comprised of various small in house operations that may the use intaglio, ink jet, and xerographic prints in their printing processes. Methodologies Regulated Sources: Emissions from large graphic arts printing facilities in the Bay Area are regulated under Regulation 8, Rule 20 and permit data for these facilities are stored in the District’s permit system called “point sources”. Under this system, throughput data of regulated graphic arts facilities is tracked and recorded in the District’s Data Bank system. The stored data along with emission factors derived from publication sources or through actual field tests provide the information used to calculate emissions of the facilities. Unregulated Sources: Emissions from small, unpermitted printing facilities are estimated based on data gathered through the U. S. Department of Commerce’s publication titled, “Printing Ink Manufacturing: 2002”. Throughput data is taken from this publication and used to estimate the emissions from unregulated sources. A growth factor based on U. S. shipment of paper production and population data of the Bay Area population was used to estimate future printing emissions. In addition to organic emissions from printing operations, adjustments were made to include emissions from cleaning solvents such as fountain solutions, preparation, and cleanup solutions. These solutions are used to clean and prepare equipment and materials for printing jobs. The sum of the calculated emissions from permitted facilities and unpermitted facilities provides an overall estimated value of emissions for Bay Area graphic arts printing sources. Monthly Variation The quarterly seasonal percent throughput data from reported companies was used to estimate the monthly variation in an area. County Distribution County location of each company as reported in the Data Bank was used to distribute emissions for each county. 6.21.2 Trends History Historical emissions were estimated based on ARB’s Manufacturing-Printing growth profile.

Control The Bay Area’s graphic arts printing industry are regulated under Regulation 8, Rule 20. This rule 20 was adopted in 1980, amended in 1984, 1985, 1989, 1993, 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2008. The Rule requires low solvent usage on inks and coatings, volatile organic compound limits of products and fountain solution and/or requirements on approved emission control system, and compliance schedules. The rule has resulted in reduced emissions for most of these categories. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["06-22-petprod-adhesive-seal.html", "6.22 Adhesive Sealants", " 6.22 Adhesive Sealants 6.22.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in these categories are fugitive organic emissions resulting from the usage of adhesives and sealants. Adhesives and sealants are primarily used in wood, wood-related, and packaging activities. The emissions reported in these categories include emissions resulting from both industrial and consumer usage of adhesives and sealants. Emissions from categories 117 and 118 include point sources. Category 118 emissions are from area sources. Adhesives and sealants are generally categorized and distinguished by source types. Most adhesives and sealants are either of a water-based type or of a solvent-based type. Adhesives and sealants can also be found, although in a smaller quantity, in the form of hot melts (100% solids), radicured, powders, and reactive types. Raw materials primarily used in the production of adhesive and sealants are rubber, starch, animal glues, bitumen, and synthetic resins. Other materials of smaller quantity that can be found in adhesive and sealant formulations include phenolic resins, formaldehyde, polyolefins, polyvinyl acetate, acrylics, polyvinyl chloride, polyesters, polyvinyl alcohol, and solvents, including hexane, heptane, xylene, toluene, methylene chloride, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Methodologies Permitted Facilities Companies utilizing large amounts of adhesives/sealants are monitored and regulated by the District’s permit system. Throughput of adhesive and sealant usage for each permitted facility are tracked and recorded in the District’s Data Bank system. Some of the industries affected under the District’s permit system for the usage of adhesives and sealants include large wood production manufacturers, wood related construction companies, and packaging companies. Emissions are calculated based on throughput data and emission factors. Emission factors used in the calculation are either derived from field tests and/or obtained from publications. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor is used in the calculation. Non-Permitted Facilities Emissions from adhesive and sealant used in non-permitted industries are estimated based on a geographical area. These emissions are termed “area source” emissions. Non-permitted industries includes construction sites, small industrial companies, transportation facilities, dental and medical buildings, electric and electronics facilities, and other miscellaneous sites. Data used to estimate area sources are based on “The Rauch Guide to the U.S. Adhesives and Sealants Industry, 2000-02 Edition”. Adjustments were made for 2008 using both the construction growth for each county in the Bay Area and the Rauch Guide’s projection. Emission factors used in the calculation of these area sources were taken from ARB’s report titled “Adhesives and Sealants”. The emission factors used in the calculations were 1,230 lbs. of VOC per ton of solvent-borne adhesives/sealants and 90 lbs. of VOC per ton of water-borne adhesives/sealants. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank was used to distribute emissions for each county. 6.22.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated based on ARB’s growth data on the construction industry.

["06-23-petprod-coat-struct.html", "6.23 Structures Coatings", " 6.23 Structures Coatings 6.23.1 Emissions Introduction The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has conducted surveys of architectural coatings marketed in California every four or five years, with the first one in 1976, and the latest one in 2005. These surveys assist both CARB and local districts track organic emissions from architectural coatings. The “2005 Architectural Coatings Survey” contains 2004 data from which this report is based upon. The categories include organic gas emissions resulting from the application of architectural coatings and associated use of additives, thinning and cleanup solvents. Architectural coatings include a variety of coatings, for example: (1) paints - flats, and non-flats, (2) clears - lacquers, varnishes, and sealers, (3) stains, (4) industrial maintenance coatings, (5) specialty coatings, etc. These coatings are used on various structures, including bridges, buildings, streets, and roofs. Emissions occur from evaporation of the organic solvents during application and air drying of the coatings. To estimate organic solvent emissions, the quantity of various types of coatings and the associated solvent content in each coating should be known. Additives are used in water- base coatings; thinning solvents are used in solvent-base coatings; cleanup solvents are used in both water-base and solvent-base coatings. There are many types of coatings and each coating formulation has its own specific amount of solvent. Each type of coating is assigned a category number. CARB apportioned each California counties’ architectural coating usage by population. The 2004 architectural coating sales (including additives and thinning and cleanup solvents) were used as a basis for determining the emissions from these categories. Future year emissions (grown and controlled) were provided by CARB. The 2008 -2012 BAAQMD Architectural Coatings TOG and ROG emissions (tons/day) for Solvent Based Coatings, Water Based Coatings, Thinning Solvents, Additives and Cleanup Solvents are shown in Table 6.29. Organic emissions from the use of clean-up and thinning solvents have been revised and a new category (Additives) has been added. Previously, thinning and cleanup solvent usage ratios were based on the assumption of one pint per gallon of solvent-based coatings. Currently, the ratios are as follows: 0.0597 gallon of thinning solvent per gallon of solvent based coating; 0.0044 gallon additives per gall water based coating; and, 0.0160 gallon cleanup solvent per gallon solvent and water based coatings. CARB also updated the ROG factors for Architectural Coatings, Thinning Solvents, Additives, and Cleanup Solvents. The following are the ROG factors being used: Table 6.29: ROG factors (CARB). Material ROG Factor Solvent Based Coatings 0.87 Water Based Coatings 1.00 Thinning Solvents 0.90 Additives 1.00 Cleanup Solvents 0.91 Monthly Variation Monthly variation in emissions was made in proportion to the average monthly sales of coatings reported in the U.S. Department of Commerce of Paint and Allied Products. County distribution Estimated Bay Area coatings emissions were distributed proportionally to the population in each county. 6.23.2 Trends History Table 6.30: BY2011 annual emission estimates for Structural Coatings.

After 2020, ABAG’s Household growth factors were used. Controls FIXME: INSERT TABLE HERE Regulation 8, Rule 3 was adopted by BAAQMD on March 1, 1978, and limits the volatile organic content of products sold for “application to stationary structures and their appurtenances, including houses, buildings, bridges, tanks, railings, streets and highways.” A lawsuit was filed which overturned a 1990 amendment; final elements of this lawsuit were settled in 1998. Also in 1998, an amendment incorporated provisions that would allow low solids architectural coatings to be sold and used within the BAAQMD. In November 2001, the District adopted an amendment that provided a further reduction in VOC to 19 of the architectural coatings. In July 2009, the District passed amendments to its Architectural Coating Rule that further limit the amount of VOC allowed in certain architectural coatings. The VOC limits were based on emissions standards recommended by the Final Approved Suggested Control Measure for Architectural Coatings developed by CARB in 2007. These amendments resulted in a VOC reduction of 4.02 tons/day in 2011 and 1.63 tons/day in 2012. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["06-24-petprod-coat-indcom.html", "6.24 Industrial Commercial Coating", " 6.24 Industrial Commercial Coating 6.24.1 Emissions Introduction The following categories contain the inventory of organic gas emissions that result from the use of industrial coatings, special product coatings, and thinning and clean-up solvents: Can and Coil (P) Wood Furniture &amp; Cabinet (P/A) Paper Coating (P/A) Fabric &amp; Film (P/A) Plastic Parts &amp; Product (P/A) Magnet Wire (P/A) Large Appliance &amp; Metal Furniture (P/A) Misc. Metal Parts &amp; Small Appliance (P/A) Flat Wood Paneling (P) Motor Vehicle Assembly Plants (P/A) Auto Refinishing (P) Marine Coating (P/A) Aerospace Assembly (P) Other Coatings (P/A) Note: The categories with a “P” in parenthesis represent point source categories only. The categories with a “P/A” in parenthesis represent both point and area source categories. These categories are composed of many types of coatings such as enamels, lacquers, varnishes, etc. Organic emissions occur from the evaporation of organic solvents, which result from the application and drying of coatings. In order to calculate emissions, the amount of coatings, the solvent fraction of the coatings, and the amount of thinning and cleanup solvent, should be known. The efficiency of control equipment, such as afterburners, condensers, and the amount of solvent recycled are all useful variables in determining emissions. Perflouorocarbons (PFC’s) may also be used in association with the “Others Coating” point source group. For the most part, they are used in the technology industry. PFC’s are non- reactive organic compound that are also greenhouse gases GHG). Methodologies For all permitted plant sites, the yearly renewal of permits provides updated industrial usage of coatings and the effects of changes to control equipment. Organic and GHG (if applicable) emissions are calculated for each piece of equipment. All large equipment and control equipment are registered, unless exempt. For each category a coatings-usage balance is made between the coatings reported in the permit data bank and the coatings-usage estimated for the category. Coatings’ usage not shown in the permit data bank is included in these categories and distributed as emissions from area sources. The area source emission factor and throughput for each relevant category are contained in the Data Bank. For each category, there are many differing formulations used; hence, a single composite emission factor is determined for each industrial category. Sources of industrial coatings-shipments are conducted nationally by the U.S. Department of Commerce. An approximation of latest available coating shipments (throughput) for the Bay Area can be estimated by applying the ratio of population for the Bay Area to the national population. This total District throughput value is subtracted from the corresponding point source throughput value to obtain a particular category’s area source throughput. Organic emissions are calculated by multiplying the solvent throughput by emission factor and control factor (if any). The exceptions to this method of area source calculations are as follows: For Wood Furniture and Cabinet Coating Categories (Cat. 1914-1915), estimating the coating usage per facility and determining the number of facilities from the latest County Business Pattern Count was used in determining the area source emissions. For Magnetic Wire Coatings Categories (Cat. 1922-1923), the District’s total throughput was based on the ratio of the number of Bay Area employees versus national employees for this particular industry. The area source throughputs and emissions are calculated similarly to the primary method (as listed above). For Auto Refinishing Coating Categories (Cat. 1928-1929), area source emissions were based on data contained in the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB) 2002 Suggested Control Measure (SCM). For Paper, Fabric and Film Coatings Categories (Cat. 1916-1919) and Misc. Metal Parts and Small Appliance Category (Cat. 1926-1927), it was assumed the area source emissions consisted of 10% of the point source emissions. For Other Coatings Category (Cat. 1932-1933), it was assumed the area source emissions were one-third of the point source emissions. Monthly Variation Monthly variation in emissions was made proportional to the monthly sales of coatings are reported by the U.S. Department of Commerce in their Current Industrial reports, Paint, Varnish and Lacquer, M28F Series. County Distribution Solvent emissions for the Bay Area were apportioned into counties by one of the methods listed below for each industrial coatings category: The county location of each company as reported in the District’s permit data bank, Employee (for a given industry) population distribution, Establishment (for a given industry) population distribution, or Total population distribution 6.24.2 Trends History Prior years’ emissions for these various categories were estimated using modified Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) growth profiles. Depending on the category, the growth profiles were based either on ABAG’s Manufacturing Employment or Service Employment. Modification was done to represent actual emissions data, primarily between the years 1993 – 2008 (although in some instances, actual emissions data went back to 1987). Growth The projected growth in emissions to the year 2030 for these various categories is based on projected forecasts in growth developed by ABAG. As mentioned previously, depending on the category, the growth profiles were based either on ABAG’s Manufacturing Employment, Service Employment or Total Population. Control The control factor is an estimate of reduction of solvent emissions, which takes into account the various strategies used to comply with regulations that are designed to gain an overall reduction of emissions in a particular category. The control factor reflects the proportion of solvent emissions remaining as a result of Regulation 8 and the various rules. The rule effectiveness accounts for the amount of emissions achieved by compliance with the rule.

Emissions from this category are from various sources and different industrial processes. The emissions for these point sources are contained in the permit data bank. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. Point source emissions are calculated from a facility’s equipment operating data submitted as part of the permit approval process. The Data Bank contains throughput information from sources submitted by individual plants. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor developed by district staff engineer is used to determine emissions. Monthly Variation The data bank contains throughput data for each month provided by companies holding District permits. County Distribution Emissions distributed into counties were based on actual locations of the plants in the Bay Area. 6.25.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data and the California Air Resources Board Manufacturing Employment growth profile.

["06-26-petprod-vacuum-truck.html", "6.26 Vacuum Truck at Refinery, Marine, Bulk Terminals", " 6.26 Vacuum Truck at Refinery, Marine, Bulk Terminals 6.26.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the operations of vacuum trucks at refineries, marine, and bulk terminals in the San Francisco Bay Area. A vacuum truck is a transportable, truck-mounted, industrial vacuum system designed to load materials into the truck’s containment vessel. Vacuum trucks are capable of loading different types of materials (either pneumatically, by external pump or by gravity feed) into their barrels under a variety of conditions. Methodologies Emissions are calculated based on throughput and source test data. Throughput data, when available, are obtained from refinery records. Source test data is taken from monitoring measurements during field studies. Because of the wide variation in test results and because most facilities do not closely track quantities of materials moved by vacuum truck, estimates of emissions and emission reduction for vacuum truck involve significant uncertainty. To determine quantities of materials moved in each category, data was taken for one refinery and scaled for other facilities to arrive at the total. Monthly Variation Monthly variation for the vacuum truck category was assumed to be uniform throughout the year. County Distribution With major refinery, marine, and bulk terminal presence, Contra Costa and Solano counties have the largest vacuum truck operations of all the San Francisco Bay Area counties. 6.26.2 Trends History Vacuum truck historical growth rate was based on data from studies and historical records. Growth Table 6.38: Growth profile configuration (DataBank, t1325). category backcast forecast profile #2224 Vacuum Truck FALSE TRUE #38 No Growth Projected growth for vacuum truck at refineries, bulk, and marine terminals is related to refinery growth. For all refinery related categories, growth was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2007) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to increase at a rate of approximately one percent per year. Control Vacuum truck is regulated under District’s Regulation 8, Rule 53 which established an emission limit that applies at the vapor exhaust outlet of the vacuum truck or associated equipment. The rule also establishes a limit for vapor leads and for liquid leaks from vacuum truck equipment. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Natural gas consists of a high percentage of methane (generally above 85 percent) and varying amounts of ethane, propane, butane, and inert gases. The combustion of natural gas in the residential sector is broken down into three categories: Space Heating, Water Heating, and Cooking. Categories 283, 284, and 285 account for area source emissions from Space Heating, Water Heating, and Cooking, respectively. Design of residential boilers and furnaces generally resemble fire tube type boilers with flue gas traveling through several channels or tubes with water or air circulated outside the channels or tubes. Methodologies Total natural gas usage for these categories was obtained from the California Energy Commission (CEC), the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), and the city of Palo Alto. This total natural gas usage was broken down into three categories based on information from CEC and PG&amp;E, and is shown below. Table 7.1: Apportionment of NG throughput.

Information on Palo Alto’s natural gas usage was obtained separately from the City of Palo Alto and was used together with Santa Clara County natural gas usage values. This was done because the city obtained gas from a supplier other than PG&amp;E. Solano and Sonoma Counties are partially in the San Francisco Bay Area Air District, so data were used for the cities that are in the District. For Solano County, data used were for Benicia, Fairfield, Suisun and Vallejo; for Sonoma County, data used were for Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and Sonoma.

Methodology Emissions estimates from domestic LPG and distillate oil combustion are based on the “BTU equivalent - natural gas approach”. This approach follows an ARB methodology as given in a document titled, “Methods for Assessing Area Source Emissions in California”, Section 5-3. The approach is based upon, namely: Number of housing units heated by LPG and distillate oil as provided by the 2010 Department of Finance’s Census of Population and Housing. Bay Area natural gas fuel usage as provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Natural gas usage conversion to average BTUs per household. Estimation of LPG and distillate oil usage based on average BTUs per household. Calculation of LPG and distillate oil emissions. Greenhouse gas emission factors are obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Monthly Variation The monthly variation for LPG and distillate oil was based on data provided by PG&amp;E Customer Accounting Department. This data details domestic natural gas usage by number of customers (dwelling units) in each county. For all counties except Solano and Sonoma, data sets reflecting the entire counties were used in the calculation. For Solano and Sonoma Counties that are both partially in the District, only data for cities within the District were used. For Solano County, data sets used were for Benicia, Fairfield, Suisun and Vallejo. For Sonoma County, data sets used were for Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and Sonoma. County Distribution County distribution of emissions was based on the Department of Commerce’s 2010 Census of Population and Housing for California. In that report, the number of homes using LPG and fuel oil as a heating medium were used in the estimate of county distribution. 7.2.2 Trends Historical Growth Table 7.4: Growth profile configuration (DataBank, t1325). category backcast forecast profile #286 LPG TRUE TRUE #658 Persons Per Household #287 Distillate Oil TRUE TRUE #252 Revised Agc 3033 For Category 286 (Fuel Combustion, Stationary Sources, Domestic LPG), an assumption was made that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow household population data.

["07-03-SS-combust-domestic-wood.html", "7.3 Domestic Solid Fuel (Wood)", " 7.3 Domestic Solid Fuel (Wood) 7.3.1 Emissions Introduction This methodology is used to estimate the criteria pollutant emissions from residential wood combustion, namely from fireplace and woodstove. Fireplaces are the most commonly utilized wood burning device in a home. They are used primarily for supplemental heating and for aesthetic appeal. Fireplace combustion is characterized by high air-to-fuel ratios and burn rates. Traditional masonry fireplaces typically contain large open fireboxes without combustion air controls and are not highly efficient heating devices. A net heat loss may occur in a residence if colder, outside air is drawn in to replace the inside air used for combustion and lost through the chimney draft. There are also prefabricated (metal) fireplaces which are slightly higher in energy efficiency than masonry fireplaces. Fireplace inserts that fit into the fireplace can increase the heating efficiency by either radiating the heat into the house or venting heated air into the house by air circulating around the insert with the help of a fan. Woodstoves are used primarily as domestic space heaters and have enclosed fireboxes and dampers to reduce air-to-fuel ratios and burn rates. Since they are stand-alone heating devices, the greater surface area radiates more heat than a fireplace. The emissions from residential fireplaces and woodstoves are highly variable, depending on the amount of wood burned and the types of woodstoves and fireplaces being used for burning wood. Many assumptions were made with the realization that any variations in one or more of these variables would substantially change the calculations. Methodologies The emission estimates for woodstoves and fireplaces were derived from BAAQMD’s wood burning survey performed between winter of 2005 and spring of 2006. This survey was performed by True North Research. Data collected from this survey includes wood burning activities via frequency, fuel type, and quantity for the Bay Area nine counties. A compilation and analysis of this data was performed by Dr. David Fairley, BAAQMD’s statistician, in a report entitled “Revised Estimates of Wood Burning in the San Francisco Bay Area Based on Telephone Survey Data”. Statistical estimation methods were used in this report to derive the annual and seasonal amount of wood burned by county. Throughputs were also derived based on data obtained from the survey. A density of 5 lbs per unit of log was assumed in the calculation. Wood stove and fire place emission factors were based on data obtained from ARB and EIIP volume IV. Composite emission factors were calculated for wood stove criteria pollutants based on an average of conventional and EPA phase II wood stove emission factors. The number of conventional versus EPA phase II wood stoves were derived based on a statistical analysis from the 05-06’ winter survey. In addition to criteria pollutant emission, greenhouse gases for wood smoke are also reported in the emission inventory. Wood smoke carbon dioxide emissions are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio-CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. Wood smoke greenhouse gas emission factors are obtained from the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Monthly Variation The monthly variation for wood burning in woodstoves and fireplaces was also derived from Bay Area’s 2005-2006 telephone survey on wood burning. Monthly variation was estimated based on sample weights assigned from the data analysis. The estimates were appropriately adjusted for county population. County Distribution There were wide county differences in the amounts of wood burned. For fireplaces, the more urban counties – Alameda, San Francisco and San Mateo – tend to have lower amounts burned per household than counties in more rural parts such as Sonoma and Napa counties. However, because of the large populations, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara were estimated to contain the largest quantity of logs burned per area. For wood stoves, Sonoma, Marin and Napa have the largest household number of logs burned per household but, again because of population, the largest number of logs burned in wood stoves per area was found in Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. 7.3.2 Trends Historical Growth Table 7.5: Growth profile configuration (DataBank, t1325). category backcast forecast profile #288 Woodstoves TRUE TRUE #613 Modified Households Woodstov #289 Fireplaces TRUE TRUE #612 Modified Households - Firepl Future projections of emissions are based on household growth in the Bay Area from 2009 “Projections” report published by ABAG. Control Control of residential wood combustion currently falls under EPA’s Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources (NSPS) for residential wood heater (stoves). (This is adopted by reference in the District Regulation 10.) The NSPS required that new residential heaters manufactured on or after July 1, 1988, or sold on or after July 1, 1990 be certified to meet particulate emission standards of 5.5 grams per hour for catalytic wood heaters and 8.8 grams per hour for non-catalytic wood heaters. These are known as Phase I stoves. More restrictive particulate emission standards were set for stoves manufactured on or after July 1, 1990 or sold after July 1, 1992. For catalytic wood heaters this was 4.1 grams per hour and for non-catalytic wood heater this was 7.5 grams per hour. These are known as Phase II stoves. Although EPA has only set emission limits for particulate matter, emission of reactive organic compounds and carbon monoxide are expected to be limited as well. Natural gas fireplaces, pellet fueled wood stoves, and EPA-certified woodstoves and fireplaces are increasing in popularity every year. Particulate emissions from these heating devices are insignificant. Some cities and counties in the Bay Area have (or are looking at) enacting new ordinances restricting new wood stove and fireplaces to these low particulate emitting heating devices. In July 2008, the District enacted a rule (Regulation 6, Rule 3) to control emissions from wood-burning devices. This rule limits emissions of particulate matter (PM) and visible emissions (VE) from wood-burning devices, including any wood-burning device, pellet- fueled wood heater or any indoor permanently-installed device burning any solid fuel for aesthetic or space-heating purposes which includes fireplaces. The rule will help to reduce PM emissions from the burning of wood in woodstoves and fireplaces. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["07-04-SS-combust-cogen.html", "7.4 Cogeneration", " 7.4 Cogeneration 7.4.1 Emissions Introduction These stationary combustion categories (290, 291 and 292) account for criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from boilers, turbines, and reciprocating engines at cogeneration plants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cogeneration plants are located at many sites in the Bay Area, including oil, chemical and food processing companies, municipal utility companies, hospitals, and military bases etc. Cogeneration plant is a power station that simultaneously generates both electricity and useful heat by utilizing one primary fuel. Modern, highly efficient power plants use the gas turbine Combined Cycle (CC). The combined-cycle gas turbine power plant consists of one or more gas turbines equipped with heat recovery steam generators to capture heat from the gas turbine exhaust. Steam produced in the heat recovery steam generators powers a steam turbine generator to produce additional electric power. Use of the otherwise wasted heat in the turbine exhaust gas results in high thermal efficiency compared to other combustion based technologies. Combined-cycle plants currently entering service can convert about 50 percent of the chemical energy of natural gas into electricity. Additional efficiency can be gained in combined heat and power (CHP) applications (cogeneration), by bleeding steam from the steam generator, steam turbine or turbine exhaust to serve direct thermal loads, such as food and chemical processing. Methodology Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the plants Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the plants through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also) Information on these specific cogeneration sources allowed them to be identified as boilers, turbines or reciprocating engines. Some of these sources may be of the “dual fuel” type, i.e., they are able to combust either gaseous or liquid fuel. EPA’s document AP-42 contains emissions information on these types of sources. The fuel specific greenhouse gas emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). County Distribution The Bay Area Air District’s point source database contains county distribution information for each facility based on its location.

All of the large steam turbine/boiler type electric power plants are located in San Francisco and Contra Costa counties. A power generation plant which converts heat energy of fuel combustion into electrical energy by utilizing a steam turbine and alternator, is known as a steam turbine power plant. Steam is produced in the boiler by combusting fuel. The steam is then expanded in the turbine to spin the steam turbine. The steam turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy. Emissions from the gas and oil fired turbines at power plants are contained in Categories 1595 and 297. Methodology Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data only, as found in the District’s data bank. Some of the boilers are of the “dual fuel” type, i.e.; they can either use natural gas (N.G.) or fuel oil. Presently only natural gas is used at the steam turbine/boiler type power plants. The Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emission rates for the large steam power plants in the Bay Area have decreased over the years (from emission rate of about 0.15 lb. / MM BTU in 1990 to about 0.057 lb/ MM BTU in 2002). The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the power plants (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the facility or general factors, i.e. from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) Emission control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the power plants also) Information on the specific sources allowed them to be identified as gas fired or oil fired boilers. Many of these sources may be of the “dual fuel” type, i.e., they are able to combust either gaseous or liquid fuel. EPA’s document AP-42 contains emissions information on these types of sources. The fuel specific greenhouse gas emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). County Distribution The District point source database contains county distribution information for each facility based on its location. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on company reported quarterly throughput/activity data. 7.5.2 Trends Historical NOx emissions from 1980 through 2002 were based on actual fuel usage data provided by power plants operating in the Bay Area. Emissions over the years have fluctuated by a factor of about 2.5 based on external factors, such as amount of rainfall and the availability of low cost hydroelectric power during that year. The NOx emissions have varied from over 30 tons/day to as low as 10 tons/day. The fuel oil usage at the power plants has been decreasing over the years. Since 1996, electric utility power plants have been prohibited from burning fuel oil by District Regulation 9, Rule 11, except for emergency situations. The Bay Area boiler/steam turbine type power plant NOx emissions have decreased from historical (e.g., 1994) levels of over 30 ton/day to about 1 ton/day in 2007. This was due to shutting down of the older inefficient boilers and the stringent Best Available Retrofit Control (BARCT) requirements of Regulation 9-11 for existing utility power plants (0.057 Lb/MMBTU or 48 ppm in 2003, 0.018 lb/MMBTU or 15 ppm in 2005) and the Best Available Control (BACT) requirements of Regulation 2-2 for new power plants (0.0089 lb/MMBTU or 7.5 ppm).

Modern, highly efficient power plants use the gas turbine Combined Cycle (CC). A combined-cycle gas turbine power plant consists of one or more gas turbines equipped with heat recovery steam generators to capture heat from the gas turbine exhaust. Steam produced in the heat recovery steam generators powers a steam turbine generator to produce additional electric power. Use of the otherwise wasted heat in the turbine exhaust gas results in high thermal efficiency compared to other combustion based technologies. Combined-cycle plants currently entering service can convert about 50 percent of the chemical energy of natural gas into electricity. Additional efficiency can be gained in combined heat and power (CHP) applications (cogeneration), by bleeding steam from the steam generator, steam turbine or turbine exhaust to serve direct thermal loads, such as food and chemical processing. Category 1596 contains estimates of fugitive emissions of Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) from power transmission and distribution system in the Bay Area. SF6 is an inorganic very potent greenhouse gas. SF6 is used in the electrical industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment. SF6 gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen that makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. Indirect greenhouse gas emission estimates from electricity imports to the Bay Area are accounted for in Category 1597. Emissions from gas and oil fired steam turbine/boiler type electric power plants are covered in Categories 293 and 294. Methodology Emissions for Categories 297 and 1595 were obtained from point source data only, as found in the Air District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the power plants (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the facility or general factors, i.e. from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Emission control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the power plants also) Emissions originate from turbines at various power plants and other facilities in the Bay Area. Many of these turbines are of the “dual fuel” type, i.e., they are able to combust either natural gas or fuel oil. Specific information on these sources allowed them to be identified as either gas or oil fired sources. The EPA’s document AP-42 contains this information on dual fuel combustion turbines and engines. The fuel specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). The SF6 emissions for Category 1596 were based on PG&amp;E’s Service Area total fugitive SF6 emissions. The SF6 emissions were apportioned to the Bay Area based on the Bay Area population as compared to total PG&amp;E Service Area population. Indirect GHG emissions from electricity imported to the Bay Area (Category 1597) were estimated based on total power consumption to power generated locally in the Bay Area. It is estimated that about one fourth to one third of electricity used in the Bay Area is imported from sources outside of the Bay Area. The emission factors (lb. /MWh) used in estimating emissions were in accordance with the PG&amp;E data. County Distribution The District point source database contains county distribution information for each facility for Category 297 and 1595. County distribution for Category 1596 and 1597 is based on population and power consumption, respectively.

Each year, the District collects and records the data from individual refinery plants via a permitting process. The data is recorded using the following as inputs: Process material throughputs (as reported by the plants, this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the plants or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors were derived based on information gather from a plant’s location, seasonal usage, and daily operation as found in the District’ Databank System. 7.7.2 Trends Historical Emissions prior to 1987 were derived from Base Year 1983 trend values. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credits (IERC) which were part of category 10. IERC banking emissions are now inventoried under categories 298-300.

This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected from these units. Control Regulation 9-10 controls emissions of NOx due to external combustion. Significant reduction in NOx emissions was observed between the period from year 2000 to 2004 for refinery external combustion operations as a result of this rule.

Category 305 accounts for emission from gas fired turbines and Category 306 from oil fired turbines, respectively. A combustion turbine is a rotary engine that extracts energy from a flow of combustion gases. It has an upstream compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in-between. The products of the combustion are forced into the turbine section. There, the high velocity and volume of the gas flow is directed through a nozzle over the turbine’s blades, spinning the turbine which powers the compressor and drives their mechanical output.

Category 314 accounts for emissions from point sources in the Air District and emissions for category 1579 were obtained from area sources. Carbon Dioxide emissions from this category are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio- CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. These categories do not include emissions from the combustion of any “auxiliary fuel” (e.g. natural gas or fuel oil) used to maintain the elevated temperatures needed to promote combustion of the waste material being incinerated (Emissions from such “auxiliary fuels” are covered in categories #307, #309, #1590 and #1591). These categories also do not include emissions from solid fuel combustion for heating, cooking, or recreational purposes, which is covered in category #289. Methodology Point Sources The District updates the point source (Category 314) data each year on a source-by- source basis using as input the following: Process material throughputs as reported by the plants. Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the plants or general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also). Area Sources Area source emissions for category 1579 were calculated based on an estimated household waste generated in the Bay Area. Most of the household waste in the Bay Area is collected and disposed of at the waste landfills. About a third of a percent of the total waste generated the Bay Area is assumed to be burnt through illegal fires. The throughput (tons/year) was estimated by multiplying the Bay Area population by an average amount of waste production per resident. An average residential daily waste production of 1.6 pounds/person/day was used for the Bay Area. The residential daily waste production data was obtained from the California Integrated Waste Management Board for the year 1998. The emission factors for category 1579, in pounds per ton (Lb/Ton) of waste materials combusted are shown below.

Categories 315, 316, 317, 318, and 319 account for emissions from open burning of orchard prunings (such as grape vines, apples, and olives), field crops (such as wheat and oats), weeds (such as ditch and canal bank, and marsh burning), range improvement (such as chaparral and grass land burning) and forest debris, respectively. Carbon Dioxide emissions from these categories are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio- CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. Methodologies Annual activity or waste material burn information for these categories was obtained from the burn permits issued by the District’s Enforcement Division for each county. Information on amounts of waste materials burned was provided to the District in various units such as acres, tons, pounds, and cubic yards. By applying the crop specific fuel loading factors and other conversion units, all burn activity was converted to tons of material burned per year. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the activity (Tons/Year) for a given category by its composite emission factor (Lb/Tons). Composite emission factors were developed using crop specific emission factor data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Background information for emission factors and fuel loading is explained in the CARB memo, the Agricultural Burning Emission Factors dated August 17, 2000.

Two-stroke engines have several attributes that are advantageous for applications such as leaf blowers. The two-stroke engines are lightweight and operate in multi-position, allowing for great flexibility in equipment applications. Typical two- stroke engines feed fuel/oil mixture into combustion chamber. A major disadvantage of two-stroke engines is high exhaust emissions. The major pollutants from a two-stroke engines are: oil-base particulates, reactive organics (a mixture of burned and unburned hydrocarbons), and carbon monoxide. Lawn, garden and other diesel equipment includes products such as walk behind mowers, garden tractors, hedge and lawn trimmers and leaf blowers. General utility equipment includes chain saws, generators, compressors, pumps, welding machines, grinders and shredders. Methodologies California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed the Off-road vehicle emission inventory (OFFROAD2007) model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The OFFROAD2007 model contains a more comprehensive list of equipment from a wider range of categories compared to BAH. The model adds an inventory estimate for engines powered by diesel fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) which were not previously accounted for. The criteria and GHG emission data for lawn, garden and utility equipment categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions was assumed to be mainly in the late spring, summer and early fall. The heaviest usage of utility equipment occurs during weekdays for commercial and weekends for residential applications. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours. County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD model. 9.1.2 Trends History Prior to the 1999 Base year emissions, the methodology for the lawn and garden equipment was based on the published report “Report on Utility Equipment Emissions in the State of California” by Booze, Allen, and Hamilton (BAH). For each type of equipment, estimates were made of the in-use population in California and percentage of use for residential and commercial applications. This was based on national equipment sales data, interviews with domestic and foreign manufacturers.

Methodologies California Air Research Board (CARB) developed an off-road vehicle emission inventory model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The OFFROAD model contained a more comprehensive list of equipment from a wider range of categories. The OFFROAD2007 model added an inventory estimate for engines powered by gasoline fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). The criteria and GHG emissions for heavy duty construction and mining equipment categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. CARB released the In-Use Off-Road Equipment model in 2011. The estimates included corrections to baseline assumptions, such as equipment population and activity data (hours of operation, load factor, etc.) as well as the impact of the recent recession and major revisions to CARB’s In-use Off-Road Diesel regulation (AB1085). Construction equipment PM10 and NOx emissions were previously overestimated. The diesel fuel consumption in the Bay Area for this updated Off-Road model produces consumption levels that are considerably lower than diesel fuel usage projected by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. As a result, the off-road diesel construction, industrial, and oil drilling equipment emission estimates have been reduced by 50% from the previous base year estimates. The updated version of CARB’s Off-Road model did not estimate for SO2, CO, and GHG emissions and other fuel types (gasoline, and natural gas). Consequently, the emission factors, emissions for gasoline and natural gas equipment were obtained from CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. The highlights of the In-Use Off-Road Equipment model are listed below: 9.4.1 - 1 Population (Number of Equipment): The total population estimates in 2009 were 26 percent lower than anticipated in 2007, mainly due to fleet downsizing during the recession. The new input population data were provided directly by California fleets. Activity Data (Hours of Use): The new activity data by equipment type were generally at least 30 percent lower than ARB staff had expected, and in some cases more than 50 percent lower than 2007 OFFROAD model. In addition, the 2009 activity was lower than 2007 largely due to the recession. Load Factor: Previous estimates from Power Systems Research were in the 60 percent range for many equipment types. ARB staff’s analyses suggested that load factors should be reduced by 33 percent. Growth Forecasts: The Growth data in the current Off-Road Construction estimates included the economic scenario to reflect the recession. ARB staff indicated that the construction activity in 2009 is lower by 50% compared to 2005 construction activity value. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions was assumed to be 60% for the months of April to September and 40% for the other remaining months. Weekly activity takes place primarily during weekdays. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours.

The ability of locomotives to haul a large amount of goods and the established network of rails throughout the state of California make locomotive an ideal transportation mechanism for goods movement. This emission inventory report accounts for emissions from three major types of locomotive operations. They include road hauling locomotive operations (category 936), switching locomotive operations (category 1681), and passenger operations (category 1722). Methodology Locomotive emission estimates for the San Francisco Bay Area are obtained from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). CARB locomotive emission inventory uses Booz-Allen Hamilton’s, “Locomotive Emission Study”, published in 1992 as a guideline for emission estimates. This study was commissioned by the Locomotive Emission Advisory Committee under Assembly Bill 234 that authorized CARB to conduct, jointly with the California railroad industry, a study of railroad locomotive emissions. An inventory was developed from this report and became the baseline inventory. Since 1992, CARB has made updates to the locomotive emission inventory. In 2003, CARB updated the emission inventory by revising growth assumptions. In 2005, CARB updated the inventory to incorporate fuel correction factors, add passenger train data, and Class III locomotives. These changes have made a significant impact on the total inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions for locomotives are calculated by multiplying activity data by standardized emission factors for each greenhouse gas. These emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Emission factor data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Trends Historical and future emissions (1970-2010) were estimated based upon the CARB emission data.

It is assumed that railroad activity would increase primarily in the area of goods movement since greater goods are needed to accommodate for an increasing population. Control In 1997, the U.S. EPA finalized the locomotive emission standard regulation. Additionally, projected emissions include expected benefits from ARB’s Clean Diesel Regulations (beginning 1993). In 2005, CARB entered into an agreement with Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF to reduce emissions from locomotives throughout California. The agreement establishes a statewide program to reduce diesel particulate emissions from locomotives at the State’s rail yards by phasing out non-essential locomotive idling, installing idling reduction devices, and maximizing the use of low sulfur fuel. It is expected that the elements of these agreement will produce approximately 20% reduction in diesel particulate matter emissions around the rail yards.

The emission inventory includes all ocean-going vessel emissions occurring within 3, 24, and 100 nautical miles from the coastline of the San Francisco Bay Area region. Methodology The methodology used to estimate OGV emissions is based on CARB’s 2005 draft report titled, “Emissions Estimation Methodology for Ocean-Going Vessels”. Although the report is in draft form, the emission data is derived based on methodology and findings given in this report. Emissions from OGVs vary based on ship type and operating mode. There are eight ship types and three operating modes accounted for in the inventory. The ship types include auto vessels, bulk carriers, container ships, passenger ships, reefers, RORO ships, tankers, and general vessels (others). The operating modes include the hotelling/berthing mode (including anchorage), maneuvering mode, and in-transit mode. Under each operating mode, the emissions are broken down by fuel. OGVs emissions vary depending on the type of fuel used to power the engines. Two fuel types, residual fuel and distillate fuel, are generally used in the operation of OGVs. These fuels are combusted in three areas: the ship’s main engine(s), the auxiliary engine(s), and the ship’s boiler(s). The emissions associated with the combustion of fuels from these OGV engines in relation to a particular ship type and operating mode are given by categories and accounted for in the inventory. In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions are included in the emission inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are taken from CARB data base. Greenhouse gas emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on the ships traffic for each month as reported by the San Francisco Marine Exchange. County Distribution For maneuvering and in-transit categories, county fractions are not based on actual port location, but rather where the emissions activity occurred during the particular mode of operation of the vessel. For example, during the maneuvering or in-transit mode, vessels may pass through several counties on their way to and from port. Berthing operations occur at port, and therefore, county fractions here are based on the port’s relevant activity. 9.7.2 Trends For detailed breakdowns of the Container and Tanker sub-categories, see charts further below. Ship emission projections were developed by ARB based on expected growth rates in the ocean-going vessels populations and activity. They also include changes in emission factors over time as the new engine standards are implemented and the fleet is turn over. Control EPA currently regulates U.S. flag ocean-going ships engine types. The rule is designed to decrease air pollutants via requirements of new ships to have more efficient fuel burning engines (category 3 engines) installed and old ships retrofitted with new engines. The rule applies only to U.S. ships. In mid-2009 via rule enactment, ARB has begun to regulate the types of fuel use for all ocean going vessels traveling within 24 nautical miles from the California coast line. All ocean going vessels are required to use low sulfur fuel within this 24 nautical mile zone. Since the enactment of this rule, there has been a significant decrease in SOx and PM emissions from ocean going vessels. Additionally, to comply with CARB Ships At-Berth Regulation, shore power installation is currently being installed by various Bay Area Ports as a mean to further reduce ship emissions. Shore power regulation mainly affects container, passenger, and refrigerated cargo vessels. It is anticipated that the usage of this power will significantly reduce hotelling emissions from ocean going vessels.

["09-08-mobile-CHC.html", "9.8 Commercial Harbor Crafts", " 9.8 Commercial Harbor Crafts 9.8.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in these categories are from the combustion of fuel from engines of commercial harbor crafts operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. The emission estimates for harbor crafts are developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and are based on numerous data sources that include data from CARB 2004 harbor craft survey, vessel population data from governmental agencies such as California Department of Fish and Game, and engine characteristic data from various harbor craft studies/reports. The definition for commercial harbor craft means any private, commercial, government, or military marine vessels including, but not limited to commercial/passenger fishing vessels, ferry/excursion vessels, crew and supply boats, tug/tow/push boats, work boats, pilot vessels, and others that do not otherwise meet the definition of ocean-going vessels or recreation vessels. The inventory accounts for emissions from harbor crafts that navigate within 3, 24, and 100 nautical miles from the coast line of the San Francisco Bay Area region. Methodologies The methodology used to estimate harbor craft emissions is based on the harbor craft methodology report found in Appendix B of CARB’s 2007 Technical Support Document: “Initial Statement of Reasons for Proposed Rulemaking, Proposed Regulation for commercial Harbor Craft”. Aside from the methodology report in Appendix B, this technical support document also includes in its appendix other reports, including the 2004 Harbor Craft Survey Report, that are used to develop some of the data used in the harbor craft emission estimates. The emission inventory account for eight types of commercial harbor crafts. They are commercial fishing, charter fishing, crew and supply vessel, ferries/excursion vessel, pilot vessel, towboat/pushboat, tug boat, work boat and others. The others category include vessels that do not fit into the other seven categories, such as vessels used to dispose of cremated remains. Most of the information used including engine population, engine hours of operation, and engine load originate from the habor craft survey. The inventory does not include vessels from the U.S. Navy and/or U.S. coast Guard vessels due to limited data available on them. For each category of vessels, emissions were calculated based on emission factors specific to the main propulsion and auxiliary engine model year. Adjustments, such as engine deterioration rate, load factor, and fuel correction factor were applied to the emission estimates. These adjustments can have a significant effect on emissions and are used in the calculation to obtain a more accurate estimate of the overall emissions. Data such as load factors were based on U.S. EPA’s Nonroad model. Deterioration rate was based on ARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. For this inventory, it is assumed that all harbor crafts operating in the San Francisco Bay Area use diesel engines for both propulsion and auxiliary power. Emission estimates for each category of vessel along with engine type (main and auxiliary) are accounted for the in the inventory. In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions are included in the emission inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are taken from CARB data base. Greenhouse gas emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Monthly and Weekly Variation For commercial harbor crafts, monthly activity was assumed to be higher in the summer months and reduced during the winter months. Weekly activity was assumed to be constant on the weekdays and reduced on the weekends. County Distribution County fractions are based on actual port location where the harbor craft is registered as home. Outer continental shelf emissions are proportioned to counties adjacent to where the emissions occurred from 3 out to 100 nautical miles. 9.8.2 Trends Emission trends forecast are based on projected fleet growth, turnover, engine deterioration, and the change of emission rates. 9.8.2.1 Control Emissions include benefits from ARB’s Clean Diesel Fuel Regulations (Beginning 1993) and Re-Formulated Gasoline Phase II (beginning 1996). These benefits were estimated using control factors developed by ARB. In 1999, federal EPA enacted the marine engine standard requirements on new commercial marine diesel engines. Dependent on the timeline, new engines put in harbor craft must meet certain tier requirements that must comply with new emission standards. Also, in 2007, CARB approved of the commercial harbor craft regulation. This regulation became effective in 2009 and places further operation and new engine requirements for all commercial harbor craft operating in California waters. The regulation also put in-use engine requirement for ferries, excursion vessels, tug boats, and towboats. It is expected that NOx and PM emission will be reduced significantly with these regulatory requirements. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["09-09-mobile-boat-recreation.html", "9.9 Recreational Boats", " 9.9 Recreational Boats 9.9.1 Emissions Introduction These categories account for fuel combustion emissions from pleasure boats with inboard or outboard engines, and personal watercraft, etc. in the Bay Area. Nearly all outboard and personal watercraft motors utilized two-stroke engines. These engines burn gasoline inefficiently and discharge as much as 30% unburned fuel into water and subsequently into the air. Spark-ignition outboard engines are available in power ratings from 2 to 300 horsepower. They are used in a wide variety of applications including fishing, water skiing and water-borne transportation. The total population of gasoline powered outboard engines in California was 373,200 in 1990. Table 9.7 shows the estimated population of outboard and personal watercraft in 1997, 2010 and 2020. As shown in Table 9.7, the population of personal watercraft is projected to double by 2020 because of continued growth and popularity of this category of marine engine. This will have a significant impact on the emissions inventory attributed to recreational boats categories. Table 9.7: Estimated Population of Outboard Engines and Personal Watercraft in 1997, 2010 and 2020 in California. Category CY1997 CY2010 CY2020 Outboard Engines 346,000 349,000 333,000 Personal Watercraft 162,000 293,000 354,000 Total 508,000 642,000 687,000 Spark-ignition outboard engines include carbureted, fuel injected and direct-injected two- stroke, and carbureted and fuel injected four-stroke configurations. Personal watercraft are defined by U.S. EPA as marine vessels that are not outboards, inboards, or sterndrive, but they can more accurately be defined as small craft on which the rider sits or stands during operation. Personal watercraft are primarily used for recreation, including touring, and water skiing. Methodologies California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed the Off-road vehicle emission inventory (OFFROAD2007) model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The criteria and GHG emission data for recreational boat categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. Monthly Variation The monthly activity occurs primarily during late spring, summer and fall. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours. County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. 9.9.2 Trends History Prior to the 1999 Base year emissions, the methodology was based upon a study by System Applications International (SAI) entitled “Development of an Improved Inventory of Emissions from Pleasure Craft in California”. The study was carried out for the California Air Resources Board and was completed in June 1995. California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Vessel Registration shows that over 98% of the boats registered are pleasure craft. The registration figures were sub-divided into 6 unique length groups and various methods of propulsion, such as inboard, outboard, jet powered and others. For each group, fuel usage was determined from a survey of 10,000 registered boat owners. The survey showed that inboard, inboard/outboard and jet powered craft were the biggest consumers of fuel. Outboard craft were found to be medium gasoline users. Others include sailboats and auxiliary sailboats and were found to have very low average annual consumption. Emission factors were obtained from National Marine Manufacturers Association. These emission factors were also used by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their Non-road Engine and Vehicle Emissions Study. These were given for outboard 2 stroke gasoline engines and inboard 4 stroke gasoline and diesel engines from several engine manufacturers including Honda, Mercury Marine, Outboard Marine Corporation, Volvo and Yamaha. The SAI Report contained average monthly, weekly and diurnal profiles for northern, southern and central California. The figures for northern California were used to develop the annual average inventory.

The growth factors utilized in the OFFROAD model are prepared in a report for the Air Resources Board entitled “A Study to Develop Projected Activity for “Non-Road Mobile” Categories in California, 1970-2020”. In this report, certain economic indicators are used to project the growth in population and usage of small off-road engines in various applications. Control In 1998, the U.S. EPA began regulating exhaust emissions from marine engines (outboard motors and personal watercrafts) to reduce 75% emissions by 2025. In December of 1998, the CARB adopted standards to require cleaner engines. Beginning with 2001 models, new outboard engines, personal watercraft and jet boats must be 75% cleaner and 90% cleaner by 2008. By: Michael Nguyen Date: February, 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["09-10-mobile-air-com-jet.html", "9.10 Commercial Aircraft, Jet", " 9.10 Commercial Aircraft, Jet 9.10.1 Emissions Introduction Considered in these categories are criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from commercial jet aircrafts during their operations at the three major airports in the Bay Area, namely, San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK), and San Jose International (SJC). A classification system for commercial aircraft was formulated consisting of major passenger, cargo, and commuter/air taxi aircraft. The major passenger aircrafts are further broken down into sub-groups of short-ranged, medium-ranged, long-ranged, and seasonal/chartered aircraft. Both the major passenger and cargo aircraft categories are primarily jet aircraft. The basic types of gas turbine engines used for commercial jet aircraft propulsion are turbojet and turbofan engines: In a turbojet engine, large quantities of air enter the engine in the front and then compressed and squeezed by the compressor before passing into the combustion chamber. This resulting mixture of fuel and air is then burned to produce hot, expanding gases. These high velocity gases pass through a turbine that is used to drive the compressor. The remaining energy in the air stream is used for aircraft propulsion. The earlier centrifugal types of compressors used in turbojets were reliable and simple, but the amount of thrust produced was relatively low because the compression ratio is not very high. These engines were also noisy and had poor fuel economy. Therefore, the quieter and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines rapidly replaced these engines. Turbofan aircraft engines power the majority of airline transports in service today. The air entering the forward end of the engine is compressed and then heated by burning fuel in the combustion chamber. The turbofan engine uses its fan to accelerate additional air around the outside of the engine (called the bypass flow) to produce a larger, slower-moving exhaust mass for efficient high subsonic propulsion. Methodology The pollutants emitted by an aircraft during take-off and landing operations are dependent on the emission rates and the duration of these operations. The emission rates are dependent upon the type of engine and its size or power rating. An aircraft operational cycle includes the landing and takeoff, or LTO cycle. For criteria pollutant emission inventory, an LTO cycle includes all normal operational modes performed by an aircraft between its descent from an altitude of about 2300 feet on landing and subsequent takeoff to reach the 2300-foot altitude. The 2300-foot limit is a reasonable approximation to the meteorological mixing depth over the Bay Area metropolitan areas. The term “operation” is used by the Federal Aviation Administration to describe either a landing or a take-off cycle. Therefore, two operations make one LTO cycle. For criteria pollutant emission calculations, the aircraft LTO cycle is divided into five segments or operational “modes” and categorized by: Landing approach (descent from about 2,300 ft. to touch down), Taxi/idle-in, Taxi/idle-out, Take-off, Climb out (ascent from lift-off to about 2,300 ft.). The emissions are based on the time of operation in each mode and the emission rates of the engines. The time in the landing approach and climbout modes are assumed to be 3.02 minutes and 1.55 minutes, respectively. Take-off time of 0.95 minute (including 0.25 minute for reverse thrust) is fairly standard for commercial aircraft and represents the time for initial climb from ground level to about 500 feet. The time in taxi/idle mode usually varies with airports. For greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory, in addition to LTO cycle explained above, the aircraft landing approach and climb out modes above 2,300 feet elevation and aircraft cruise mode in the District’s air space is also included. The information on number of aircraft operations and fleet mix was obtained from the three major commercial airports in the Bay Area, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Metropolitan Traffic Commission (MTC). Modal emission rates for aircraft engines in commercial use were obtained from the FAA’s Aircraft Engine Emission Database, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Emission rates vary according to engine type and operating mode.

A classification system for commercial aircraft was formulated consisting of major passenger, cargo, and commuter/air taxi. The commuter/taxi class is primarily of the piston type. In the piston engine, the basic element is the combustion chamber. Mixtures of fuel and air are burned in this chamber from which energy is extracted by a piston and crank mechanism driving a propeller. The turboprop engine has a propeller turned through a system of gears from a gas turbine system; it usually delivers more thrust–up to medium- high subsonic airspeeds. The majority of the commuter/taxi aircraft use this turboprop engine propulsion.

These include: Startup, idle and taxi out, Takeoff, Climb out to about 2,300 feet–this height is considered the average mixing depth in the Bay Area and assumed inversion height, wherein aircraft exhaust emissions are released below it, Descent/approach from about 2,300 feet, touch down, and landing run, and Taxi in, idle and shutdown. For greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory, in addition to LTO cycle explained above, the aircraft landing approach and climb out modes above 2,300 feet elevation and aircraft cruise mode in the District’s air space is also included. The information on number of operations and fleet mix were obtained from the airports, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Metropolitan Traffic Commission (MTC). Estimates of aircraft mix for each of the airports were developed based on historical activity and data on home-based aircraft. The LTO cycle has its equivalent operating time-in-mode (TIM) which is the time for a particular aircraft to go through each of the five modes. Composite modal emission rates (MER) for each of the various types of aircraft engines now in general aviation use were developed from various information sources on aircraft engines. These information sources include the FAA’s Aircraft Engine Emission Database, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Only combustion products from the aircraft engine during spraying are estimated in this category. This does not include emissions from materials sprayed, which are inventoried under pesticide category. The aircraft involved are usually piston engine type aircraft. The most common agricultural aircraft are fixed-wing but helicopters are also used. In the aircraft piston engine, mixture of fuel and air are burned from which energy is extracted by a piston and crank mechanism driving a propeller. Methodology Fuel consumption by agriculture aircraft in the Bay Area was estimated based on number of acres sprayed and fuel used per acre. The information on estimated number of acres sprayed was obtained from the county agricultural crop reports for 1996. Total acreage for field, vegetable, fruit, nut and nursery crops were used in estimating a District total of 178,705 acres sprayed. An average fuel consumption of 0.1053 gal per acre sprayed was used based on the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) report on the total number of acreage sprayed and total statewide fuel usage. From this information, an estimated total fuel usage was derived: \\[ \\text{Total fuel usage} = 0.1053\\ \\text{gal/acre} \\times 178,705\\ \\text{acre} = 18,818\\ \\text{gal} \\] Emission factors were derived based on EPA document AP-42 for a Lycoming 0-320 and Continental 0-200 aircraft engines.

["09-17-mobile-onroad-motor.html", "9.17 On Road Motor Vehicles", " 9.17 On Road Motor Vehicles 9.17.1 Emissions Introduction There are nearly 5.0 million on-road motor vehicles in the Bay Area, traveling an estimated daily average of 175 million miles. On-road motor vehicles emissions account for a large portion of the Bay Area total emissions. Realistic estimation of the emission trends from motor vehicles is an essential element of controlling and improving air quality. Methodologies To estimate emissions from a large fleet of vehicles many variables are required. The most important is the rate at which a vehicle produces various pollutants. This is usually referred to as emission factor; it varies with vehicle age, type, and operating conditions, such as speed and ambient temperature. Another important variable is called the fleet activity. This term relates to the number of in-use vehicles, number of trips and the vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The computer model for calculation of emission factors and county-specific emissions in California was developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). It has undergone many improvements and refinements, the latest version EMFAC2011 (Version 1.1, January 2013) was used for this inventory. It supersedes EMFAC2007, the previous version of this model, which was used for base year 2008. For a full description of the model and further supporting documentation, reference should be made to ARB’s Website at http://www.arb.ca.gov/msei/modeling.htm. Brief description of the model is given below: The new EMFAC2011 comprises a suite of three modules: EMFAC2011-LDV. The first module, named EMFAC2011-LDV, is used as the basis for estimating emissions from gasoline powered on-road vehicles, diesel vehicles below 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, and urban transit buses. The algorithms used in EMFAC2011-LDV for passenger cars are the same as those used in EMFAC2007. The Bay Area activity for this module is from MTC’s activity based model “Travel Model One”, which uses ABAG’s Projection 2009 demographic/socio-economic and land use and forecasts developed and adopted in March 2009. EMFAC2011-HD. The second module, called EMFAC2011-HD, is the basis for emissions estimates for diesel trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating greater than 14,000 pounds operating in California. This model is based upon the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule emissions inventory that was developed between 2007 and 2010 and approved by the Air Resources Board in December 2010. The truck and bus population and vehicle miles traveled estimates in EMFAC2011-HD are identical to those presented to the Board. Emission factors in the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule inventory were based on statewide, annual average emission factors and adjusted for improvements to fuel economy, medium-heavy duty truck emission factors, and other new information. EMFAC2011-HD emissions estimates include all of the improvements made as part of the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule inventory and then add the traditional detailed EMFAC methods that provide emission rates for annual, summer, and winter seasons on a regional basis. EMFAC2-011-SG. EMFAC2011-SG, takes the output from EMFAC2011-LDV and EMFAC2011-HD provided annual average, county-specific emissions. The module also has the ability to apply scaling factors to estimate emissions for user-defined vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and speeds. The module also provides planning inventories. Temperatures chosen for calculating these inventories are averages of ten worst air quality days (summer temperatures for high Ozone days and winter temperatures for high CO occurrences). In each case, the variation in temperature during the day is also taken into account. 9.17.2 Trends Estimates of VMT and trips for 2000-2035 were submitted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) based on ABAG projections 2009 as described above. Prior years were unchanged from the previous estimates which were based projections of travel activity used in the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP2030). Control There are three types of controls for motor vehicle emissions: Emission Standards. Since 1972, introduction of more stringent emission standards has caused the entire motor vehicle fleet to become cleaner as newer vehicle replace the old ones. The introduction of California’s Low Emissions Vehicles Program in 1994 will ensure that this trend has continued into the present century. Most recently, regulations were adopted by ARB to reduce emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks and buses. Clean Fuels Program. This program includes Re-Formulated Gasoline Phase I (started January 1990), the Winter-time Oxygenated Fuels Program (introduced in November 1992) and Reformulated Gasoline Phase II (beginning January 1996). To reduce sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions, CARB has also regulated the sulfur content in both gasoline and diesel fuels. The latest regulations beginning 1997, reduced sulfur content of diesel fuel to 15 part per million. Inspection and Maintenance program (I/M). Also known as the Smog Check, this program was introduced in 1984. Enhancement to the original I/M were introduced in 1990, with further improvements phased in beginning 1994. In October 2003, ARB started implementing the Enhanced I/M Program (Smog Check II) in the Bay Area. As a result, further ROG, but more importantly NOx, emission reductions were achieved. More changes were made to the program mandated by State law beginning January 1, 2013. Benefits from these controls are included in the emissions estimates. In addition, there are controls to reduce motor vehicle use and congestion. These are generally referred to as Transportation Control Measures. Examples of these are programs that increase transit usage and signal timing projects. The benefits from some of these measures are included as part of the travel data (less VMT, less congested speed, etc.), and hence, already included in the emissions estimates from the relevant version of the emissions model.

The commercial airports are San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK), and San Jose International (SJC). The Bay Area is also home to a military airbase in Solano County, the Travis Air Force Base (AFB). Examples of the equipment include baggage/aircraft tractors and tugs, ground power units, air start units, auxiliary power units, cargo belt loaders, cargo moving equipment, fuel trucks, food service trucks, and other assorted service vehicles. The majority of the equipment in use at the Bay Area commercial airport is fueled by gasoline or diesel; however, some equipment is fueled by alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or electricity. Methodology Emissions, emission factors, equipment population and other factors such as break horsepower (BHP), load factors, typical hours of usage and equivalent ratios used are in accordance with the California Air Resources Board’s Off-Road Model 2007.

The PM emissions result from construction operations such as digging, loading, scraping, grading, compacting, light duty vehicle traffic, etc. Emission factors were based on a study done by Midwest Research Institute. This study produced an average emission factor of 0.11 ton PM10/acre-month for these construction operations. (This value is assumed to include the effects of typical control measures, such as watering. Watering is assumed to control dust by 50%.) However, in the Bay Area, it was assumed 20% of construction activity consisted of large-scale operations that involved substantial earthmoving operations. Under this “worst-case” scenario, the emission factor was 0.42 ton PM10/acre-month. Therefore, the overall composite emission factor used for these construction activities in the Bay Area was 0.172 ton PM10/acre-month. It is assumed that all the above-mentioned construction operations have the same emission factor. The California Air Resources Board provided the PM speciation profile (PM10 fraction of 0.4893). Activity data (throughputs) are expressed in terms of acre-months for the above categories. Methodologies Residential Construction (Category 744) The number of new housing units (single and multi-family), provided by the California Department of Finance, is used to calculate the acreage disturbed. The affected construction area for a single family living unit is estimated at 1/7th of an acre for Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties; and 1/5th of an acre for Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. The affected construction area for multi-family living units is estimated to be 1/20th of an acre. The construction time for residential units is assumed to be 6 months. . The throughput, expressed in acre- months, is estimated by multiplying the appropriate area factors, construction time and number of new units for each county. Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional Construction (Categories 745 -747) The estimated construction acreage for these categories is based on project valuations supplied from the California Department of Finance. The valuations for commercial, industrial, and institutional construction are 3.7, 4.0, and 4.4 acres per million dollars of valuation, respectively. Since these factors are 1977 values, multiplying the above valuations by the ratio of 1977 to a particular year’s Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Consumer Price Index value makes inflationary corrections for that particular year. The construction time for commercial, industrial, institutional buildings is assumed to be 11 months. The throughput for a particular year, expressed in acre-months, is found by multiplying that year’s inflationary adjusted project valuation by the county’s construction valuation, and construction time. Road Construction (Category 748) The latest road construction for freeways, highways, county and city roads was estimated by the difference in their respective total mileage between that year’s and prior year’s data, as reported in the California Statistical Abstract. The affected area per mile of road for freeways, highways, and county and city roads are 12.1, 9.2, and 7.8 acres/mile, respectively. The construction time for roads is assumed to be 18 months for the average project. The throughput, expressed in acre-months, is estimated by multiplying the road construction miles, affected area per mile of road factor, and project duration time. The emission factor (which includes any controls) used for all categories mentioned above was estimated at 0.3515 ton PM/acre-month (703.0 lbs. PM/acre-month), with the PM10 fraction at 0.4893. The total emissions for these categories are determined by multiplying the throughput and emission factor. Monthly Variation The monthly variations of emissions for the Bay Area counties in Category 744 – 748 were based on the ARB’s seasonal profiles for Building and Road Construction Dust. Roughly, emissions were distributed as 55% during the months of April to September and 45% during the remaining months. County Distribution Distribution of emissions into counties was based on construction activity provided by the California Department of Finance. 10.1.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination prior emissions data (back to 1987) and the ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment Growth Profile.

["10-02-misc-farm.html", "10.2 Farming Operations", " 10.2 Farming Operations 10.2.1 Emissions Introduction Farming Operations consist of two categories, Agricultural Land Preparation (Category 749) and Agricultural Harvest Operations (Category 1435). The methodology for emission calculation and temporal activity for both these categories were taken from the California Air Resources Board’s (ARB’s) Emission Inventory Procedural Manual Section 7.4 (Agricultural Land Preparation, revised January 2003) and Section 7.5 (Agricultural Harvest Operation, revised January 2003). Category 749 accounts for particulate emissions generated by farming operations such as tilling, plowing, discing, leveling, etc. These activities are normally performed in the early spring and/or fall months. Therefore, particulate emissions from agricultural tilling are highly dependent on type of crop, climate, soil properties and equipment characteristics. Category 1435 accounts for particulate emissions caused from harvest activities. These activities include harvest vehicles traveling over the soil, mechanical processing of crop and underlying soil, or removal of crop waste material through blowing or sweeping action. As of this writing, the only crops in California that had harvest particulate emissions factors were almonds, cotton, and wheat. All other relevant crops are assigned emission factors by scaling from these three measured values. Emissions from fuel combustion of agricultural equipment, such as mowers, tractors, tillers, etc., are accounted for in Category 1655 (Agricultural Equipment, Gasoline-4 Stroke), Category 1656 (Agricultural Equipment, Evaporative-4 Stroke), and Category 1646 (Agricultural Equipment, Diesel). Methodology Category 749 Agricultural land preparation particulate emissions for each crop are estimated using the following equation: \\[ \\text{Emissions}_{crop} = \\text{Emission Factor}_{crop} * \\text{Acres}_{crop} \\] The crop specific PM10 emission factors are calculated by multiplying a land preparation emission factor (i.e. root cutting, discing, rippling, weeding, land planning, etc.) with the number of passes performed per acre that are needed to prepare a field for planting a particular crop (acre-pass). A crop may have multiple land preparation operations with its corresponding number of acre-passes. In this case, the crop specific emission factor is the sum of acre-pass weighted emission factor for each land preparation operation. For example, the crop PM10 emission factor for garlic is as follows: Table 10.2: Crop-specific PM10 emission factor for garlic (lb/acre-yr). Crop Operation Oper.

Example 1: Calculate the 2010 PM10 and total particulate emissions from land preparation activities for garlic in Santa Clara County, where the crop specific PM10 emission factor = 6.5 lbs PM10/acre/yr, 366 acres were devoted to garlic in 2010, and the PM10 factor is .4543. \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM}_{10}\\ \\text{emissions} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{6.5\\ lb}{acre \\cdot yr}\\times 366\\ acre \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 2379\\ lb/yr \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1.19\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\end{eqnarray} \\] \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM emissions} &amp;=&amp; 1.19\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\div 0.4543 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 2.62\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM} \\end{eqnarray} \\] Each of the county’s crops are estimated in this fashion and then summed for the total PM10 emissions. The nine counties within the Bay Area were summed to get the District total. (The District’s portion of Solano and Sonoma Counties were 38% and 32%, respectively.) PM emissions are calculated by dividing PM10 value by 0.4543. Category 1435 Agricultural Harvest Operations particulate emissions for each crop are estimated using the following equation: \\[ \\text{Emissions}_{crop} = \\text{Emission Factor}_{crop} * \\text{Acres Harvested}_{crop} \\] The individual crop emissions for each county were summed to produce county and District wide total particulate and PM10 agricultural harvest emissions. The PM10 emission factors were taken from Table 2 of ARB’s Agricultural Harvest Operations document. Using the PM10 emissions factors for cotton, almonds, and wheat as a baseline, other crop’s PM10 emission factors were estimated. The number of acres to each applicable crop was obtained from either the county’s annual agricultural crop reports or the California Agricultural Statistics Service (CASS). Example 2: Calculate the 2010 PM10 and total particulate emissions from agricultural harvest operations for walnuts in Contra Costa County, where the Crop specific PM10 emission factor = 40.77 lbs PM10/acre, 399 acres were devoted to walnuts in 2010, and the PM10 factor is .4543. \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM}_{10}\\ \\text{emissions} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{40.77\\ lb}{acre \\cdot yr}\\times 399\\ acre \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 16267\\ lb/yr \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 8.13\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\end{eqnarray} \\] \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM emissions} &amp;=&amp; 8.13\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\div 0.4543 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 17.90\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM} \\end{eqnarray} \\] Each of the county’s crops are estimated in this fashion and then summed for the total PM10 emissions.

The Structural Fires category is an area source category that includes residential and commercial buildings as well as mobile and trailer home fires. Methodology The methods used to calculate emissions for this category conforms to the methods used by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The total number of structural accidental fires in California was acquired from the State Fire Marshal’s Office. Structural fires were apportioned to the Bay Area based on number of households in the Bay Area as compared to total California households. Structural losses. For building and mobile home fires, an average percent structural loss per fire was calculated by dividing the total monetary damage due to fires by the product of the average value of a residence in California and the number of residential fires. The result is an average loss of 7.3% per fire. According to census data and the National Association of Home Builders, the average residence has approximately 1,649 square feet of floor space and an average of 11,000 board feet of lumber in its structure. Assuming an average of one ton of material per 1000 board feet, an average residence would have approximately 11 tons of combustible material. With a rate of loss of 7.3%, the structural loss would be 0.80 tons per fire. Content losses. The National Bureau of Standards lists the combustible contents per square foot of the functional areas of the average home. These figures were multiplied by the percent of fires originally estimated to occur within each of these areas, and the products were then added to give a weighted average of 7.91 lb/sq. ft. as shown in 10.4.

Carbon Dioxide emissions from this category are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio- CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. Planned or prescribed fires such as weed burning, field crops, prunings, range improvement burning and forest management are covered in categories 315-319. Methodology Methodology for this category is in accordance with the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) document “Methods for Assessing Area Source Emissions in California” for the Wildfires. Activity data (acreage burnt) estimates were obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) and CARB. Wildfire emissions are calculated using the Geographic Information System (GIS) based Emission Estimating System (EES) model developed for ARB by UC Berkeley’s Center for the Assessment and Monitoring of Forest and Environmental Resources (CAMFER) laboratory. Wildfire footprint is overlaid on vegetation landcover map, calculating the amount of each fuel consumed in the fire. Fuel loading is assigned for each fuel component that makes up the vegetation type. Emission factors and vegetation acreage consumed vary from fire season to fire season depending on type of vegetation consumed and weather conditions. For example, average composite emission factors and amounts of acreage burnt in the Bay Area by county are shown below for year 2008 2011.

The method used to calculate emissions for this category conforms to the method used by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Methodology The total number of automobile accidental fires in California was acquired from the state fire marshal’s office. Automobile fires were apportioned to the Bay Area based on Bay Area population as compared to California’s total population.

Methodology The methodology for estimating particulate emissions from vehicular travel on paved roads was updated in the Final Section of Fifth Edition of U.S. EPA’s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors AP42 document, Volume I, Chapter 13.2.1. The methodology was adapted and refined for California by CARB. For a full description of this methodology and references, please see CARB’s methodology document “2013 Update_7 9 PavedRds Meth.pdf”. A brief description is given below: Emission rates are a function of vehicle weight and silt loading as shown in the following equation: \\[ E = k \\left(\\frac{sL}{2}\\right)^{0.91} \\times \\left(\\frac{W}{3}\\right)^{1.02} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{4N}\\right) \\] where: \\(E\\) is the particulate emission factor in grams per vehicle miles traveled (VMT); \\(k\\) is the particle size multiplier used to compute PM10 and PM2.5 (1.0 and 0.25 grams/mile respectively); \\(sL\\) is the roadway silt loading in grams per square meter; \\(W\\) is the average vehicle weight in tons; \\(P\\) is the number of “wet” days with at least 0.254 mm (0.01&quot;) of precipitation; and \\(N\\) is the number of days in the averaging period, 365 for yearly or 30 for monthly. California specific silt loading for different road types were measured in a study carried out by Midwest Research Institute (MRI) in 1995. Roads were divided into four classes with the corresponding silt loading factors (\\(g/m^2\\)): Table 10.13: California-specific silt loading factors (MRI 1995). Road Type sL Freeway/Expressway 0.02 Major Street/Collector 0.32 Local Street 0.32 Rural 1.60 Average vehicle weight (\\(W\\)) was assumed to be 2.4 tons, based on vehicle counts performed during the MRI study. Estimated fraction of county VMT in each of the four roadway types were taken from 2008 data by Highway Performance Monitoring Systems (HPMS). County specific 2011 VMT data were taken from California Air Resources Board EMFAC2011-SG model. Number of wet days (\\(N\\)) for each county was derived from the most appropriate meteorological station for that county. The monthly fraction of annual VMT came from monthly Caltrans VMT highway data prepared for the Sacramento Office of the Federal Highway Administration. These were combined with the number of wet days in the relevant month to develop a monthly profile. 10.6.2 Trends History In previous base years, emissions from paved road dust travel were assumed to grow proportionally with VMT. According to this assumption, Bay Area road dust emissions should have increased by 30% between 1990 and 2011 based on growth in VMT. Ambient air monitoring data and chemical mass balance analysis do not show this trend.

Thus, CARB proposed that instead of using VMT as a surrogate for growth, roadways center line miles (CLM) are used. MTC’s CLM data show an increase of less than 2% for the same period (less than 0.1% per year), and this was used to create trends around the 2011 base year emissions. By: A. K.

The methodology was developed by the California Air Resources Board. For a full description of this methodology and references, please see CARB’s methodology document “2012 Update_7 10 Unpaved Roads Dust Meth (2).pdf”. Four types of unpaved roads are considered: City and County; Parks and Forests; Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA); and Farm. Methodologies The city and county unpaved road mileage were taken from California Statewide Local Streets and Roads Needs Assessment (CSLSRNA), Final Report for the League of California Cities. This report shows that there are no unpaved roads under city and county jurisdiction in the Bay Area. For parks and forests, Caltrans’ Maintained Public Record Mileage for 2008 were used. The most recent available Caltrans Maintained Public Record Mileage containing BLM/BIA unpaved road mileage for 1998 was used. The report shows BLM/BIA unpaved roads in Sonoma county only. The total VMT for each type of road was estimated by assuming 10 miles of travel per day for each mile of unpaved road. For farm roads, county specific number of acres for various types of crops were taken from California County Agricultural Commissioners reports of 2008 harvested crop acreage. Crop specific VMT were applied to the harvested crop acreage for each county in the Bay Area to estimate county VMT. Emission factor for all types of road used is assumed to be 2.0 pounds of PM10 per vehicle mile traveled. This is the average of 22 unpaved road dust emission tests performed in San Joaquin Valley for light-duty truck traffic. The measurements were performed as part of studies by University of California, Davis (UCD) “Evaluation of the Emissions of PM10 Particulates from Unpaved Roads in the San Joaquin Valley, Final Report, April 1994” and the Desert Research Institute (DRI) “Effectiveness Demonstration of Fugitive Dust Control Methods for Public Unpaved Roads and Unpaved Shoulders of Paved Roads, Final Report, December 1996”. Emissions for 2011 were estimated using growth rates described in the following section. Temporal Variations It was assumed that wet days (with precipitation over 0.01&quot;) prevent these emissions from occurring. The VMT is also assumed to drop significantly during winter months. ARB combined these factor to develop monthly variations for each county. Activity is assumed to be the same during the week.

This category also includes waste material generated from portable or semi-permanent toilets and discharged to the sanitary sewer system. Methodology A report on “Evaluation of Emissions from Selected Uninventoried Sources in the State of California”, by R. Dickson; W.R. Oliver, and S. Tate showed an estimate of discharged material to the sewer systems in the United States. This estimate of national loading to sewers was adjusted for the Bay Area. In the report, about 50% of volatile organic compounds (VOC) was assumed from the discharged material volatilizes in the sewer prior to becoming influent to treatment plants. It was further assumed that 50% of the volatilized materials have already been accounted for in other categories, such as cleanup solvent. An emission factor of 250 lbs of organics per thousand pounds of industrial sewer loading was also developed based on the above report. The VOC Emissions are calculated by multiplying the throughput data with the emission factor. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on estimated load throughout the year.

Methodologies Total acreage for field crops, vegetable crops, fruit and nut crops, nursery crops, plants, flowers and miscellaneous crops were obtained for each county as reported in the “Agricultural Crops”. The estimated crop acres were used as throughput for the calculation of wind erosion from agricultural fields (Category #764). The number of miles of unpaved road for each county were estimated from the “California Abstracts”, and converted into acreage. It was assumed a typical width of a road was 25 feet. The acreage of unpaved road was used as throughput for the calculation of windblown dust from unpaved roads (Category# 765). Particulate emission factor from dust emissions were developed based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s equation: \\[ \\text{Emission Factor} = E \\times I \\times C \\times K \\times L \\times V \\] where \\(E\\) = portion of total wind erosion loses as suspended particulates \\(I\\) = soil erodibility, t/acre/yr \\(C\\) = climatic factor \\(K\\) = surface roughness factor \\(L\\) = unsheltered field width factor \\(V\\) = vegetative cover factor (\\(K\\), \\(L\\), \\(V\\) depends on the crop type) Typical Values of above constants Agricultural Land Unpaved Roads E 0.025 .038 I 38 - 220 86, 47, 56 C 0.15 0.15 K 0.8, 0.6, 0.1, 0.6 1.0 L 0.74, 0.83, 0.77, 0.56 .29 - .34 V 0.05, 0.91, 0.26, 0.26 1.0 Particulate emissions from agricultural windblown dust were calculated by multiplying the crop acres by the emission factors developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as above.

Mainstream smoke (MS), which is generated during puffs, is generally inhaled by the smoker and a small fraction is exhaled. Sidestream smoke (SS), or the smoke issued from the product between puffs, is viewed as the most important emissions. Burning cigarettes may include total particulate matter, nicotine, phenol, CO2, CO, NOx, NH3, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. Methodology Cigarette consumption was based on a report from Atmospheric Environment Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2, “Measuring Environmental Emissions from Tobacco Combustion: Sidestream Cigarette Smoke Literature Review”, by M.R. Guerin, Higgens, &amp; Senkins. The reported stated that about 48% of the smokers smoked less than a pack of cigarettes, 32% smoked one pack, 15% smoked two packs, and 5% smoked 2.5 packs or more per day. A recent finding showed that although there has been a decrease of adult smokers, there was also an increase in younger smokers, and therefore, it is still estimated 10% of the population (or 743,744 cigarette smokers) are still smoking regularly in the Bay Area. The cigarette consumption is estimated as followed: \\(743,744 \\times (48\\% \\times 0.5 + 32\\% \\times 1 + 15\\% \\times 2 + 5\\% \\times 2.5) \\times 20 = 14,651,759\\) cigarettes/day (or 5,477.47 tons cigarettes per year) Emission factors were derived based on the Table 1 of the report.

["10-13-misc-pesticide.html", "10.13 Non-Consumer Pesticides", " 10.13 Non-Consumer Pesticides 10.13.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 1190 – 1193 account for emissions from all pesticide usage for agricultural, commercial, and institutional purposes. Agricultural use includes pesticide applications to crops, rangelands, pastures, cemeteries, parks, golf courses, and along roadsides and railroad right-of-ways. Additionally, all post-harvest pesticide treatment of agricultural goods, along with pesticide use in poultry, fish production, and some livestock applications all fall under the agricultural definition. Non-agricultural use includes structural operators, professional gardeners, and (non-agricultural) pest control operators. These categories do not include pesticides sold from retail stores in small quantities for home consumers. Consumer pesticides are covered in consumer product categories 1494-1509. Prior to 1996, the agricultural and non-agricultural pesticide divisions each consisted of application and residual categories for both synthetic and non-synthetic pesticides. The District had eleven categories associated with non-consumer product pesticides. Creosote application was considered a separate category. In 1996, the two divisions (agriculture and non-agriculture) were broken down into methyl bromide and other categories. The creosote application category is now incorporated in both the agricultural and non-agricultural pesticide’s “Other” categories. Methodologies The following table lists the Pesticides Categories and their 2011 total organic emissions (TOG) in tons/day.

The TOG emissions data for the years 2005 to 2009 are actual data estimated from the DPR Pesticide Reports. For Categories 1190 and 1191, the 2010 and 2011 the TOG emissions were grown from the year 2007. The year 2007 is the mid-point of the 5 year average. (Both ARB and DPR agreed the use of a 5-year average of historical data as an adjusted value would account for weather and pest infestation variability in agricultural pesticide emissions.) For Categories 1192 and 1193, the 2010 and 2011 TOG emissions were grown from the year 2009. Monthly Variation Monthly activity variation data is based on pesticide usage data in the Bay Area. County Distribution The county distribution is also based on pesticide usage for each county in the District. 10.13.2 Trends Historical The historical growth profile for the agricultural pesticides categories (Cats. 1190 and 1191) was based on a combination of prior adjusted emissions data (1990 - 2011) and a growth profile (from DRI94/DPR) provided by ARB.

["10-15-misc-biogenic.html", "10.15 Biogenic", " 10.15 Biogenic 10.15.1 Emissions Introduction Living vegetation throughout the Bay Area produce the biogenic organic emissions covered by these four emission categories. (Such vegetation is considered to be part of the general group known as “area” sources). Chemical analysis of biogenic emissions by investigators has led to their being classified into four separate chemical groupings. This detail has been maintained in the four categories developed for this Base Year emission inventory, and covered by this methodology. Methodologies Emissions were obtained from a presentation at CARB’s EITEAC Meeting on May 19, 2004. Biogenic emissions were estimated using the ARB’s BEIGIS model. Model inputs include the California GAP Analysis Project, California Department of Water Resources crop reports, SCAG and SANDAG (councils of government) urban land use, and satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) data. The BEIGIS model is driven by temperature and solar radiation, BVOC emission factors and specific leaf weight factors.

["10-16-misc-ODSS.html", "10.16 Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Substitutes", " 10.16 Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Substitutes 10.16.1 Emissions Introduction Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are being phased out under the terms of the Montreal Protocol and the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. ODS include chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC’s), carbon tetrachloride, etc., and have been used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, solvent cleaning, foam production, sterilization, aerosol and fire extinguishing applications. The substitutes approved to replace the ODS include hydrofluorocarbons (HFC’s) and perfluorocarbons (PFC’s) emit both total organic gases (TOG) and greenhouse gases (GHG’s), many of which have high global warming potentials (GWP’s). All of the ODS Substitutes are non-reactive, so there are no reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions. The use of these ODS substitutes have steadily increased since 1990. Methodology The TOG and GHG emissions were estimated using California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (6th Edition, updated August 1, 2013) data. CARB emission totals represented values for the entire state and were divided into 4 sectors (commercial, industrial, residential and transportation). Within each sector, the ODS Substitutes were further divided by usage (i.e. Aerosols, Fire Protection, Foams, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, and Solvents, if applicable). The District’s portion of the State’s total was estimated by comparing 2011 data in Table B-3 (Total Population of California Counties), Table C-4 (“Wage and Salary Workers in Nonagricultural Establishments By Industry, California”) and Table C- 7 (“Wage and Salary Workers in Nonagricultural Establishments By Industry, California Metropolitan Areas”) of the California Department of Finances Statistical Abstract. For the residential sector, the population in the Bay Area District counties was compared to the State population. The number of Bay Area workers in the industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors were compared to the number of state workers in these sectors. In 2011, the fraction of Bay Area population and workers to that of State population and workers in the residential, industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors were 0.19, 0.14, 0.23, and 0.18, respectively. Each ODS Substitute, depending upon sector, was multiplied by this fraction and the State value. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions for these categories is assumed to be uniform throughout the year. County Distribution The county distributions for these categories were based on Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 Projections Data for 2011. For those emissions in the commercial, industrial, residential, and transportation sectors, ABAG’s data from retail employment, manufacturing and wholesale employment, population, and transportation and utility employment, respectively, were used. Each category may have a combination of aforementioned sectors, so a composite county fraction was calculated based on the sector’s emission (within the category). 10.16.2 Trends History Emission data from 1990 – 1999 was based on trend data from CARB’s 1990 – 2004 GHG Inventory by IPCC Category.

High Priority Cogeneration: Estimated CY1990-2007 TOG emissions for category #292 Reciprocating Engines are too low, compared to CH4. (The CH4/TOG ratio for those years is well above 1, generally in the range of 3x to 30x.) About 1,000 ton/yr TOG and 100 ton/yr ROG may be missing for those years. See BY2011_annual_emission_data %&gt;% filter_categories(&quot;#292 Cogen: Recip Eng&quot; = 292) %&gt;% filter_pollutants(&quot;TOG&quot;, &quot;CH4&quot;, &quot;ROG&quot;) %&gt;% tabulate_emissions_by(category, year, pol_abbr) %&gt;% mutate(``CH4/TOG`` = CH4/TOG) %&gt;% View(). The CO2/CO ratio for category #293 Gas Fired Boilers for CY1990-2000 appears to be far too low, given what is observed for subsequent decades. This could be resulting in the absence of 5-10 MMTCO2eq from the CY1990 BAAQMD inventory. An absence of CO2 of that magnitude, in CY1990, could be substantially distorting the answer to the key question of whether the District is “on track” to reach its CY2030 target. (Possibly related.) Emissions for #294 Oil Fired Boilers seem to be almost entirely absent from the BY2011 inventory. There are some very small emissions (~ 0.1 ton/yr of TOG and NOx) estimated for CY2008-2010, but that is it. Road Dust: The emissions for Paved Roads are exactly flat. The paragraph under Growth states that “MTC’s CLM data show an increase of less than 2% for [1990 to 2011] (less than 0.1% per year), and this was used to create trends around the 2011 base year emissions.” However, the growth is not 2% per 20 years; it is exactly flat, because the relevant categories are all linked to profile #38 No Growth. TO BE CONTINUED… Medium (or maybe Low or High) Priority Petroleum Refining Facilities General Refinery Emissions: For category #10, BY2011 NOx emissions are much lower than DataBank numbers would indicate. SOx and PM emissions, on the other hand, are consistent. For category #16 “Other”, CO2 emissions are large (~3 MMTCO2eq) and linearly increasing, which is mildly inconsistent with profiles for other pollutants in this category. Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization: TOG emission rates for two isolated years (CY1999-2000) are above 3 ton/yr. There are no estimates before CY1999. Estimates after CY2000 are exactly zero. According to the text, “Emissions for category 20 have been relatively insignificant for last few years, at less than 5 pounds per day for the entire region.” 5 lb/day is approximately 1 ton/yr, and so should be visible on the chart. The growth profile is also inconsistent with the published emission numbers. Chemical Manufacturing Facilities Coatings and Inks: The paragraph under “Control” states that “the amended regulation has resulted in an 84% emission reduction since 1993,” but according to what’s in DataBank, the controlled fraction for category #23 seems to be 54%. Other Industrial and Commercial Processes Recycling and Shredding: PM emissions for #2223 Recycling and Shredding (Fugitive) are missing (not zero; actually missing) for years CY1990-1995. The growth profile assigned to this BY2011 category is zero for those years. Concrete Batching: While the TSP estimates for the point-source component (category #39) align well with DataBank RY/PY data, the historical PM estimates exhibit differences on the order of 100 ton/yr for years CY1990-2000. Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion: Emissions of all pollutants for #1748 Cement Plant Combustion (Coal) are missing (not zero; actually missing) for CY2008 and CY2010-2030. However, emissions for CY2009 are present. The growth profile assigned to this BY2011 category, #877 “Cement Plt. Comb. - Coal”, is also zero for the same years, and also has a spike at CY2009. Rubber Manufacturing: Emissions of TOG and ROG classified as #46 Rubber Products Mfg (point) increase sharply at CY2011, from less than 1 ton/yr to 19 ton/yr. (1) Upon inspection with a pivot table, over 95% of this increase is attributable to the sudden appearance in the RY/PY inventory of a source S#32100 Fugitive Organic Emissions at facility P#110 Burke Industries. A constant 18.26 tons/yr TOG is attributed to this source. The facility has been in continuous operation since at least CY1990; it is implausible that no fugitive TOG or ORG was emitted from it prior to CY2011. (2) Interestingly, one can also see that RY1990 TOG and ROG emissions from P#110 S#32110 are also 18.26 ton/yr TOG, but between CY1991 and CY2010, TOG S#32100 disappears from the RY inventory. (3) The growth profile (#847) associated with this point-source category never dips below 100%, so all emissions before CY1990 should have been calculated to be 20 ton/yr or more, not zero. The backcast flag in DataBank is set to FALSE, but because this could have been changed between the generation of the CAP inventory and the BY2011 GHG inventory, it’s not solid evidence that the CAPs for this category were not backcast. Looking back in time, category #P46 can be found in the BY2008 inventory. In the BY2008 inventory, it comprises about 0.4-0.6 ton/yr TOG from CY1990 to 2030. Asphaltic Concrete Plants: There is a peak in SO2 emissions at CY2010 that does not seem to match the profile of other pollutants nor the assigned growth profile (#817 Asphaltconcrplts (Modgc646)). Oil Fields: For category #1575, the BY2011 emission factor for CH4, in Table 4.22, appears not to match the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 4.21.1 - 2). Gas Fields: For category #1576, the the BY2011 emission factor for CH4, in Table 4.24, appears not to match the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 4.22.1 - 2). Sand Blasting: The paragraph under Control refers to Regulation 6 and [Regulation 12-14], and states that “Controls can range up to 99% or higher.” However, no BY2011 control factors for the relevant categories (#42 or #1909) appear to be stored in DataBank. See DB_CTLFAC_CONCORDANCE and/or use BY(2011) %&gt;% DB_control_factors() to pull the relevant CFs. Other Miscellaneous Industrial/Commercial: Comparing across pollutants, emission values at CY2010 exhibit strange up/down variations. The general shapes of the rest of the years seems generally consistent both (a) across pollutants, and (b) with the assigned growth profiles. Waste Management Land Farming: The growth profile does not seem to match the published emissions for CY1990-1995. Further, the CY1990 emissions for TOG are sharply increased at CY1990. A probable cause: the emission factor for TOG changed abruptly, from CY1990 (TOG = 20 lb/ton) to CY1991 onwards (TOG = 2.24 lb/ton). Try BY2011_annual_area_source_emission_factor_data %&gt;% filter_categories(52) %&gt;% filter_years(CY(1990:1991)) %&gt;% spread(year, ef_qty). Although this affects TOG, it is not reflected in published CY1990 emissions of CH4. Composting: Like Other Miscellaneous Industrial/Commercial, when comparing across pollutants, emission values at CY2010 exhibit strange up/down variations for category #1709 Composting (area). The general shapes of the rest of the years seems generally consistent both (a) across pollutants, and (b) with the assigned growth profiles. Also, the point/area growth profiles assignments seem to be mixed up: profile #862 Composting-Area Source is assigned to category #1936 Composting (Point), and profile #863 Composting-Point Source is assigned to #1709 Composting (which is an area-source, not a point-source, category). Finally, there are changes in the emission factors for category #1936 over time. This may be intended, but it is unusual for a point-source category to be assigned time-varying EFs. Petroleum Products Evaporation and Leakage Portable Fuel Container Spillage: The text states that “CARB estimates 3.57 tons of uncontrolled ROG emissions per day statewide from portable fuel containers in 2011.” That 3.57 ton/day is equal to 1,304 ton/yr. In the BY2011 inventory, the estimated CY2011 total for category #1434 Portable Fuel Container Spillage is 1,303 ton/yr ROG. The Bay Area total should not be equal to the statewide total. (Perhaps the text is incorrect instead?) Industrial and Commercial Coatings: Marine: Categories #1930 and #1931 are missing emission data for CY2005-2008. These aren’t zeros; there are just no rows in the BY2011-annual-A.csv file, for these categories, for CY2005-2008. Marine Loading: (1) The very last paragraph under “Controls” refers to “Categories 795 - 802”, but #801 and #802 are not elsewhere mentioned, and no emissions for #801 or #802 appear in the published BY2011 inventory. (Are they unintentionally missing?). (2) Category #90 “Ballasting, Other Material” has time-varying emission factors. This is not inherently a problem, but the pattern looks remarkably like the assigned growth profile (#835 Ballasting-Other). This could be causing an unintentional “double-counting” (amplification) of the year-over-year variation. Related: the same thing happens with Farming Operations. Non-Gasoline Terminals and Bulk Plants Storage: There is an apparent “cliff” in the TOG/ROG emissions where they drop from ~200 ton/yr (CY1990-2009) to ~20 ton/yr. Upon inspection of the RY/PY data, we can see that ~20 ton/yr is consistent with all the TOG values recorded in RY data for this category for many years, except for one: RY2008 (which is ~200 ton/yr). It seems plausible that either the 200 ton/yr datapoint was an artifact (which should not dictate all of CY1990-2009), or that the constant 20 ton/yr is a systematic underestimate. If true, then one or the other should be corrected. Gasoline Truck Loading: There is a sudden “peak” in emissions circa CY2005. It is consistent with growth profile #589 Revised Bulk Plant Tputs but atypical compared to the rest of the profile. There is also a “seesaw” at CY2008-CY2008, dropping from ~400 ton/yr ROG to less than 1 ton/yr, then back up to ~400 ton/yr, then back down to a fairly constant ~20 ton/yr. Sterilizer Venting: CY1994 emissions are exactly zero. Save for that year, estimated emissions are a constant 0.365 ton/yr ROG, despite (a) a positively sloped growth profile (CY1990-2030) and (b) steep changes in the historical control profile (CY1990-1995). Asphalt Paving: (minor) The text states “organic emission factors used for hot-mix, emulsified, and road oils were 0.04, 17.9, and 2.19 lb/ton of asphalt applied, respectively.” There are control factors in DataBank for #95 Road Oil (97.5% controlled, CY1990-2030) and #97 Emulsified (55.3% controlled, CY1990-2030), but nothing for #96 Hot Mix. If we apply those (DataBank) CFs to the (DataBank) EFs listed in Table 6.20, then we do in fact arrive at the EFs mentioned in the text (#95 = 2.2 lb/ton and #97 Emulsified). So the math works out, but it is odd to have a mixture of controlled (for #96) and uncontrolled (for #95 and #97) EFs stored in DataBank. Vacuum Trucks: The paragraph under “Growth” refers to 1% growth, but the BY2011 growth profile for this category is flat. Stationary Combustion of Fuels Domestic Fuel, LPG &amp; Liquid Fuel: For category #286 Domestic LPG, the growth is described as “follow[ing] household population data”. But the assigned growth profile is #658 Persons per Household, which is the number of persons in an average household (fairly constant), not the total population. Minor: for category #287 Distillate Oil, the forecast is described as “2% reduction per year”; it seems to be about 1.7% (with rounding, OK). Domestic Solid Fuel (Wood): First, the CY1990-2000 growth profiles for Sonoma County are odd, compared to the profiles for other counties. This artifact is apparent in two growth profiles: #612 Modified Households - Firepl; and #613 Modified Households Woodstov. Second, the text states that “projections of emissions are based on household growth,” but the actual forecast is exactly flat (zero growth). Back-up Diesel Generator: Category #1598 should be (re)assessed. Other External Combustion - All Other Fuels: For category #312 Other Fuels, the ratio (CH4 + ROG) / TOG is about 1.5 for CY2000-2030. This ratio should never be more than 1/1. The inventoried estimates are a few hundred tons per year of each of these pollutants (CH4, ROG, and TOG). Waste Burning Incineration: First, category #1579 Incineration (Area) has a large and linear decline from CY1990-1995 that is unexplained. This may be attributable to BAAQMD regulations. Second, this category has a CO/CO2 ratio of about 0.003. This is a high combustion efficiency, on par with a well-maintained boiler. Typical CO/CO2 ratios for garbage and vegetation burning (“open burning”) are an order of magnitude higher. See, for example, Akagi (2011). (NOTE: in the BY2011 inventory, Category #1579 is associated with CO2_bio, rather than CO2.) Planned Agricultural Burning: Looking at category #316 Field Crops, CY2001-2008, there is a substantial “surge” in inventoried emissions. This apparent surge is on the order of hundreds of tons of most criteria pollutants. If there is reason to believe that this really happened in the world, it’s probably worth an explanation. It appears to be reflected in — or attributable to — DataBank growth profiles #726 and #727. Mobile Combustion Recreational Boats: Emissions of many pollutants drop to exactly zero at five-year intervals (CY2020, 2025, 2030, …, etc.), and then return to the previous trend. Lawn &amp; Garden Equipment: For no pollutant is the projected growth, CY2011-2030, close in magnitude to the growth expressed by the assigned growth profiles. (The assigned growth profiles increase to +75% by CY2030.) Try, for example: BY2011_annual_emission_data %&gt;% filter_categories(1647:1651) %&gt;% filter_pollutants(&quot;NOx&quot;) %&gt;% chart_annual_growth_by(color = cat_id, base_year = CY(2011), flag_years = CY(2030)). TODO: check this for other OFFROAD categories (rec boats, TRUs, etc.). Also, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Transportation Refrigeration Units (TRUs): Like Lawn &amp; Garden Equipment, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Agricultural Equipment: Like TRUs, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Also, #1646 Ag Equip (Diesel) is linked to growth profile #464 Commercial Boats. (?) Construction Equipment: SO2 emissions appear spiky, particularly between CY1998-2010. Industrial Equipment: TOG emissions for #1667 (Natural Gas) exhibit the same zero-every-5-years artifact that is present in Recreational Boats, only this time it is isolated to one pollutant (TOG). Also, SO2 from #1666 (Diesel) grows much more rapidly than any other pollutant. Light Commerical Equipment: CO2 and CH4~ for #1672 (Diesel) drop to exactly zero at CY2010, then resume the previous trend. Also, N2O for #1668 (Gasoline, 4-stroke) is exactly zero for CY2026-2030 (same as rec boats, TRUs, ag equip, etc.). Off Road Motorcycles &amp; All Terrain Vehicles: Emissions for several sub-categories exhibit odd behavior at 5-year intervals, similar to the above. Ships: BY2011 categories are actually #2041:2220, not #1787:1887. Miscellaneous Other Sources Animal Waste, Livestock: Table 10.16 in the Methodology section is inconsistent with the same table as shown in the BY2011 Methodology PDF. One example: there are 28,753 sheep in Solano, with a total of 53,884 sheep District-wide. In the BY2011 Methodology PDF, those numbers are 3,804 and 28,937 respectively. The former table is created automatically from BY2011_area_source_throughput_data, itself derived from t0325. The code that produces the table is in misc-animal-livestock.Rmd. Farming Operations: Emission factors for these two categories (#749 and #1435) vary by time in a way that strongly resembles the growth profiles. If this is an accidental, it could be causing a “double-counting” of the magnitude of the decrease from CY1990-2010. If it is intentional, it probably warrants some extra documentation. Related: the same thing happens with Category #90 “Ballasting, Other Material”. Accidental Structural Fires: The BY2011 emission factors in Table 10.5 appear not to match the relevant table in the the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 10.3.1 - 2). Accidental Auto Fires: The BY2011 emission factor for TOG, in Table 10.10, appears not to match the relevant table in the BY2011 Methodology PDF. Accidental Vegetation Fires: The BY2011 throughputs (burned acreage), in Table 10.7, appear not to match the relevant table in the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 10.4.1 - 2). Consumer Products: The CY2011 TOG emissions listed in Table 10.24 appear slightly different than the values on page 10.14.1-1 of the BY2011 Methodology PDF. TO BE CONTINUED… "],
