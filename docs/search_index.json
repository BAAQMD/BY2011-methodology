Two-stroke engines have several attributes that are advantageous for applications such as leaf blowers. The two-stroke engines are lightweight and operate in multi-position, allowing for great flexibility in equipment applications. Typical two- stroke engines feed fuel/oil mixture into combustion chamber. A major disadvantage of two-stroke engines is high exhaust emissions. The major pollutants from a two-stroke engines are: oil-base particulates, reactive organics (a mixture of burned and unburned hydrocarbons), and carbon monoxide. Lawn, garden and other diesel equipment includes products such as walk behind mowers, garden tractors, hedge and lawn trimmers and leaf blowers. General utility equipment includes chain saws, generators, compressors, pumps, welding machines, grinders and shredders. Methodologies California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed the Off-road vehicle emission inventory (OFFROAD2007) model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The OFFROAD2007 model contains a more comprehensive list of equipment from a wider range of categories compared to BAH. The model adds an inventory estimate for engines powered by diesel fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG) which were not previously accounted for. The criteria and GHG emission data for lawn, garden and utility equipment categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions was assumed to be mainly in the late spring, summer and early fall. The heaviest usage of utility equipment occurs during weekdays for commercial and weekends for residential applications. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours. County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD model. Trends 2.1.1.1 History Prior to the 1999 Base year emissions, the methodology for the lawn and garden equipment was based on the published report “Report on Utility Equipment Emissions in the State of California” by Booze, Allen, and Hamilton (BAH). For each type of equipment, estimates were made of the in-use population in California and percentage of use for residential and commercial applications. This was based on national equipment sales data, interviews with domestic and foreign manufacturers. Average HP rating, hourly use and load factor for each type of equipment were estimated for both commercial and residential applications. Growth Projected emissions for lawn, garden and utility equipment categories were estimated based on ARB’s Off-road vehicle emission inventory model. The growth factors utilized in the OFFROAD model are based on a report for the Air Resources Board entitled “A Study to Develop Projected Activity for “Non-Road Mobile” Categories in California, 1970-2020”. In this report, certain economic indicators are used to project the growth in population and usage of small off-road engines in various applications. Control In December of 1990, the CARB adopted two levels of emission standards for small off- road engines. The first phase of standards (Tier 1) was implemented in 1995 and Tier 2 standards are scheduled for implementation in 1999. The deterioration rates for 4 stroke Tier 1 engines were derived from data supplied by engine manufacturers. Since engines meeting Tier 2 standards are not yet available, engineering judgment was used to estimate the effect of the more stringent standards. The first set of regulations for utility engines came into effect on January 1, 1994. These were in the form of specific emission standards for different sizes and types of engines used in this type of equipment. More stringent standards came into effect in January 1999.

County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. 2.2.2 Trends History Prior to the 1999 Base year emissions, the methodology for the transportation refrigeration units was based on the published report: “Report on Utility Equipment Emissions in the State of California”. The average engine power, hours of use per year and emission factors for each type of unit were taken from a study conducted by Booze, Allen, and Hamilton Inc. (BAH). Total number of refrigeration units was based on the Department of Motor Vehicles’ registration data for regular commercial trucks and trailers by county. The total was distributed to counties using this data. The BAH study showed that all transportation refrigeration units consist of diesel units and there are no longer any gasoline power units. Growth Projected emissions for the transportation refrigeration units categories were estimated based on ARB’s Off-road vehicle emission inventory model. The growth factors utilized in the OFFROAD model are based on a report for the Air Resources Board entitled “A Study to Develop Projected Activity for “Non-Road Mobile” Categories in California, 1970-2020”. In this report, certain economic indicators are used to project the growth in population and usage of small off-road engines in various applications. In general, the population of small off-road equipment is expected to increase by approximately 34% between 1990 and the year 2010.

County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. 2.3.2 Trends History Prior to the 1999 Base Year emissions, the methodology for farm equipment was based on the published report: “Report on Utility Equipment Emissions in the State of California” by Booze, Allen, and Hamilton (BAH). For each type of equipment, such as tractors, bailers and combines, state-wide annual sales records were available for different types of engine (gasoline and diesel) and power rating (up to 500 hp). BAH also developed average hourly use and load factor for each type of equipment mentioned above. The statewide activity (in brake horse-power-hour) was thus estimated. The annual activity was distributed to counties by the acreage harvested in each county taken from the Agricultural Crop Report. Emission factors were obtained from Power Research Systems, the Engine Manufactures Association. Growth Projected emissions for farm equipment categories were estimated based on ARB’s Off-road vehicle emission inventory model. The growth factors utilized in the OFFROAD model are prepared in a report for the Air Resources Board entitled “A Study to Develop Projected Activity for “Non-Road Mobile” Categories in California, 1970-2020”.

["mobile-offroad-diesel.html", "2.4 Construction, Mining, Industrial/Light Commercial, &amp; Other Off-Road Diesel Equipment", " 2.4 Construction, Mining, Industrial/Light Commercial, &amp; Other Off-Road Diesel Equipment 2.4.1 Emissions Introduction These categories account for exhaust emissions from heavy duty non-farm gasoline and diesel equipment used in construction, mining and logging operations. Methodologies California Air Research Board (CARB) developed an off-road vehicle emission inventory model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The OFFROAD model contained a more comprehensive list of equipment from a wider range of categories. The OFFROAD2007 model added an inventory estimate for engines powered by gasoline fuel, compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). The criteria and GHG emissions for heavy duty construction and mining equipment categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. CARB released the In-Use Off-Road Equipment model in 2011. The estimates included corrections to baseline assumptions, such as equipment population and activity data (hours of operation, load factor, etc.) as well as the impact of the recent recession and major revisions to CARB’s In-use Off-Road Diesel regulation (AB1085). Construction equipment PM10 and NOx emissions were previously overestimated. The diesel fuel consumption in the Bay Area for this updated Off-Road model produces consumption levels that are considerably lower than diesel fuel usage projected by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. As a result, the off-road diesel construction, industrial, and oil drilling equipment emission estimates have been reduced by 50% from the previous base year estimates. The updated version of CARB’s Off-Road model did not estimate for SO2, CO, and GHG emissions and other fuel types (gasoline, and natural gas). Consequently, the emission factors, emissions for gasoline and natural gas equipment were obtained from CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. The highlights of the In-Use Off-Road Equipment model are listed below: 9.4.1 - 1 Population (Number of Equipment): The total population estimates in 2009 were 26 percent lower than anticipated in 2007, mainly due to fleet downsizing during the recession. The new input population data were provided directly by California fleets. Activity Data (Hours of Use): The new activity data by equipment type were generally at least 30 percent lower than ARB staff had expected, and in some cases more than 50 percent lower than 2007 OFFROAD model. In addition, the 2009 activity was lower than 2007 largely due to the recession. Load Factor: Previous estimates from Power Systems Research were in the 60 percent range for many equipment types. ARB staff’s analyses suggested that load factors should be reduced by 33 percent. Growth Forecasts: The Growth data in the current Off-Road Construction estimates included the economic scenario to reflect the recession. ARB staff indicated that the construction activity in 2009 is lower by 50% compared to 2005 construction activity value. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions was assumed to be 60% for the months of April to September and 40% for the other remaining months. Weekly activity takes place primarily during weekdays. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours. County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s 2007 OFFROAD model. 2.4.2 Trends History For detailed breakdowns of the Construction, Industrial, and Light Commercial equipment sub-categories, see charts further below.

["locomotives.html", "2.5 Locomotives", " 2.5 Locomotives 2.5.1 Emissions Introduction Locomotives are an important mode of transportation for the movement of goods in the state of California. The ability of locomotives to haul a large amount of goods and the established network of rails throughout the state of California make locomotive an ideal transportation mechanism for goods movement. This emission inventory report accounts for emissions from three major types of locomotive operations. They include road hauling locomotive operations (category 936), switching locomotive operations (category 1681), and passenger operations (category 1722). Methodology Locomotive emission estimates for the San Francisco Bay Area are obtained from the California Air Resources Board (CARB). CARB locomotive emission inventory uses Booz-Allen Hamilton’s, “Locomotive Emission Study”, published in 1992 as a guideline for emission estimates. This study was commissioned by the Locomotive Emission Advisory Committee under Assembly Bill 234 that authorized CARB to conduct, jointly with the California railroad industry, a study of railroad locomotive emissions. An inventory was developed from this report and became the baseline inventory. Since 1992, CARB has made updates to the locomotive emission inventory. In 2003, CARB updated the emission inventory by revising growth assumptions. In 2005, CARB updated the inventory to incorporate fuel correction factors, add passenger train data, and Class III locomotives. These changes have made a significant impact on the total inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions for locomotives are calculated by multiplying activity data by standardized emission factors for each greenhouse gas. These emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Emission factor data was obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Trends Historical and future emissions (1970-2010) were estimated based upon the CARB emission data. Growth Growth factors for locomotives are based on U.S. industrial production and various railroad statistics available from the Association of American railroads. It is assumed that railroad activity would increase primarily in the area of goods movement since greater goods are needed to accommodate for an increasing population. Control In 1997, the U.S. EPA finalized the locomotive emission standard regulation. Additionally, projected emissions include expected benefits from ARB’s Clean Diesel Regulations (beginning 1993). In 2005, CARB entered into an agreement with Union Pacific Railroad and BNSF to reduce emissions from locomotives throughout California. The agreement establishes a statewide program to reduce diesel particulate emissions from locomotives at the State’s rail yards by phasing out non-essential locomotive idling, installing idling reduction devices, and maximizing the use of low sulfur fuel. It is expected that the elements of these agreement will produce approximately 20% reduction in diesel particulate matter emissions around the rail yards.

["mobile-ship.html", "2.7 Ships", " 2.7 Ships 2.7.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in these categories are from combustion of fuel from engines of commercial ocean-going vessels (OGVs). The emission estimates for OGVs are developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and are based on numerous sources that include data from CARB OGV surveys, vessel population data from governmental agencies such as State Land Commissions, and engine characteristic data from various OGV studies and manufacturer reports. The inventory accounts for commercial OGVs greater than or equal to 400 feet in length or 10,000 gross tons or propelled by a marine compression ignition engine with a displacement equal to or greater than 30 liters per cylinder. The emission inventory includes all ocean-going vessel emissions occurring within 3, 24, and 100 nautical miles from the coastline of the San Francisco Bay Area region. Methodology The methodology used to estimate OGV emissions is based on CARB’s 2005 draft report titled, “Emissions Estimation Methodology for Ocean-Going Vessels”. Although the report is in draft form, the emission data is derived based on methodology and findings given in this report. Emissions from OGVs vary based on ship type and operating mode. There are eight ship types and three operating modes accounted for in the inventory. The ship types include auto vessels, bulk carriers, container ships, passenger ships, reefers, RORO ships, tankers, and general vessels (others). The operating modes include the hotelling/berthing mode (including anchorage), maneuvering mode, and in-transit mode. Under each operating mode, the emissions are broken down by fuel. OGVs emissions vary depending on the type of fuel used to power the engines. Two fuel types, residual fuel and distillate fuel, are generally used in the operation of OGVs. These fuels are combusted in three areas: the ship’s main engine(s), the auxiliary engine(s), and the ship’s boiler(s). The emissions associated with the combustion of fuels from these OGV engines in relation to a particular ship type and operating mode are given by categories and accounted for in the inventory. In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions are included in the emission inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are taken from CARB data base. Greenhouse gas emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on the ships traffic for each month as reported by the San Francisco Marine Exchange. County Distribution For maneuvering and in-transit categories, county fractions are not based on actual port location, but rather where the emissions activity occurred during the particular mode of operation of the vessel. For example, during the maneuvering or in-transit mode, vessels may pass through several counties on their way to and from port. Berthing operations occur at port, and therefore, county fractions here are based on the port’s relevant activity. 2.7.2 Trends For detailed breakdowns of the Container and Tanker sub-categories, see charts further below. Ship emission projections were developed by ARB based on expected growth rates in the ocean-going vessels populations and activity. They also include changes in emission factors over time as the new engine standards are implemented and the fleet is turn over. Control EPA currently regulates U.S. flag ocean-going ships engine types. The rule is designed to decrease air pollutants via requirements of new ships to have more efficient fuel burning engines (category 3 engines) installed and old ships retrofitted with new engines. The rule applies only to U.S. ships. In mid-2009 via rule enactment, ARB has begun to regulate the types of fuel use for all ocean going vessels traveling within 24 nautical miles from the California coast line. All ocean going vessels are required to use low sulfur fuel within this 24 nautical mile zone. Since the enactment of this rule, there has been a significant decrease in SOx and PM emissions from ocean going vessels. Additionally, to comply with CARB Ships At-Berth Regulation, shore power installation is currently being installed by various Bay Area Ports as a mean to further reduce ship emissions. Shore power regulation mainly affects container, passenger, and refrigerated cargo vessels. It is anticipated that the usage of this power will significantly reduce hotelling emissions from ocean going vessels.

["mobile-CHC.html", "2.8 Commercial Harbor Crafts", " 2.8 Commercial Harbor Crafts 2.8.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in these categories are from the combustion of fuel from engines of commercial harbor crafts operating in the San Francisco Bay Area. The emission estimates for harbor crafts are developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and are based on numerous data sources that include data from CARB 2004 harbor craft survey, vessel population data from governmental agencies such as California Department of Fish and Game, and engine characteristic data from various harbor craft studies/reports. The definition for commercial harbor craft means any private, commercial, government, or military marine vessels including, but not limited to commercial/passenger fishing vessels, ferry/excursion vessels, crew and supply boats, tug/tow/push boats, work boats, pilot vessels, and others that do not otherwise meet the definition of ocean-going vessels or recreation vessels. The inventory accounts for emissions from harbor crafts that navigate within 3, 24, and 100 nautical miles from the coast line of the San Francisco Bay Area region. Methodologies The methodology used to estimate harbor craft emissions is based on the harbor craft methodology report found in Appendix B of CARB’s 2007 Technical Support Document: “Initial Statement of Reasons for Proposed Rulemaking, Proposed Regulation for commercial Harbor Craft”. Aside from the methodology report in Appendix B, this technical support document also includes in its appendix other reports, including the 2004 Harbor Craft Survey Report, that are used to develop some of the data used in the harbor craft emission estimates. The emission inventory account for eight types of commercial harbor crafts. They are commercial fishing, charter fishing, crew and supply vessel, ferries/excursion vessel, pilot vessel, towboat/pushboat, tug boat, work boat and others. The others category include vessels that do not fit into the other seven categories, such as vessels used to dispose of cremated remains. Most of the information used including engine population, engine hours of operation, and engine load originate from the habor craft survey. The inventory does not include vessels from the U.S. Navy and/or U.S. coast Guard vessels due to limited data available on them. For each category of vessels, emissions were calculated based on emission factors specific to the main propulsion and auxiliary engine model year. Adjustments, such as engine deterioration rate, load factor, and fuel correction factor were applied to the emission estimates. These adjustments can have a significant effect on emissions and are used in the calculation to obtain a more accurate estimate of the overall emissions. Data such as load factors were based on U.S. EPA’s Nonroad model. Deterioration rate was based on ARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. For this inventory, it is assumed that all harbor crafts operating in the San Francisco Bay Area use diesel engines for both propulsion and auxiliary power. Emission estimates for each category of vessel along with engine type (main and auxiliary) are accounted for the in the inventory. In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gas emissions are included in the emission inventory. Greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2, CH4, and N2O, are taken from CARB data base. Greenhouse gas emission factors take into account fuel-specific carbon content and the percent of carbon that oxidizes to convert to greenhouse gas emissions. Monthly and Weekly Variation For commercial harbor crafts, monthly activity was assumed to be higher in the summer months and reduced during the winter months. Weekly activity was assumed to be constant on the weekdays and reduced on the weekends. County Distribution County fractions are based on actual port location where the harbor craft is registered as home. Outer continental shelf emissions are proportioned to counties adjacent to where the emissions occurred from 3 out to 100 nautical miles. 2.8.2 Trends Emission trends forecast are based on projected fleet growth, turnover, engine deterioration, and the change of emission rates. 2.8.2.1 Control Emissions include benefits from ARB’s Clean Diesel Fuel Regulations (Beginning 1993) and Re-Formulated Gasoline Phase II (beginning 1996). These benefits were estimated using control factors developed by ARB. In 1999, federal EPA enacted the marine engine standard requirements on new commercial marine diesel engines. Dependent on the timeline, new engines put in harbor craft must meet certain tier requirements that must comply with new emission standards. Also, in 2007, CARB approved of the commercial harbor craft regulation. This regulation became effective in 2009 and places further operation and new engine requirements for all commercial harbor craft operating in California waters. The regulation also put in-use engine requirement for ferries, excursion vessels, tug boats, and towboats. It is expected that NOx and PM emission will be reduced significantly with these regulatory requirements. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["recreational-boats.html", "2.9 Recreational Boats", " 2.9 Recreational Boats 2.9.1 Emissions Introduction These categories account for fuel combustion emissions from pleasure boats with inboard or outboard engines, and personal watercraft, etc. in the Bay Area. Nearly all outboard and personal watercraft motors utilized two-stroke engines. These engines burn gasoline inefficiently and discharge as much as 30% unburned fuel into water and subsequently into the air. Spark-ignition outboard engines are available in power ratings from 2 to 300 horsepower. They are used in a wide variety of applications including fishing, water skiing and water-borne transportation. The total population of gasoline powered outboard engines in California was 373,200 in 1990. 2.1 shows the estimated population of outboard and personal watercraft in 1997, 2010 and 2020. As shown in 2.1, the population of personal watercraft is projected to double by 2020 because of continued growth and popularity of this category of marine engine. This will have a significant impact on the emissions inventory attributed to recreational boats categories. Table 2.1: Estimated Population of Outboard Engines and Personal Watercraft in 1997, 2010 and 2020 in California. Category CY1997 CY2010 CY2020 Outboard Engines 346,000 349,000 333,000 Personal Watercraft 162,000 293,000 354,000 Total 508,000 642,000 687,000 Spark-ignition outboard engines include carbureted, fuel injected and direct-injected two- stroke, and carbureted and fuel injected four-stroke configurations. Personal watercraft are defined by U.S. EPA as marine vessels that are not outboards, inboards, or sterndrive, but they can more accurately be defined as small craft on which the rider sits or stands during operation. Personal watercraft are primarily used for recreation, including touring, and water skiing. Methodologies California Air Resources Board (CARB) developed the Off-road vehicle emission inventory (OFFROAD2007) model to estimate emissions from off-road motor vehicles for all counties and air basins in California. The criteria and GHG emission data for recreational boat categories in the Bay Area were obtained from the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. Monthly Variation The monthly activity occurs primarily during late spring, summer and fall. Most of the daily activity occurs during daylight hours. County Distribution County emissions were provided by the CARB’s OFFROAD2007 model. 2.9.2 Trends History Prior to the 1999 Base year emissions, the methodology was based upon a study by System Applications International (SAI) entitled “Development of an Improved Inventory of Emissions from Pleasure Craft in California”. The study was carried out for the California Air Resources Board and was completed in June 1995. California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) Vessel Registration shows that over 98% of the boats registered are pleasure craft. The registration figures were sub-divided into 6 unique length groups and various methods of propulsion, such as inboard, outboard, jet powered and others. For each group, fuel usage was determined from a survey of 10,000 registered boat owners. The survey showed that inboard, inboard/outboard and jet powered craft were the biggest consumers of fuel. Outboard craft were found to be medium gasoline users. Others include sailboats and auxiliary sailboats and were found to have very low average annual consumption. Emission factors were obtained from National Marine Manufacturers Association. These emission factors were also used by Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in their Non-road Engine and Vehicle Emissions Study. These were given for outboard 2 stroke gasoline engines and inboard 4 stroke gasoline and diesel engines from several engine manufacturers including Honda, Mercury Marine, Outboard Marine Corporation, Volvo and Yamaha. The SAI Report contained average monthly, weekly and diurnal profiles for northern, southern and central California. The figures for northern California were used to develop the annual average inventory. Growth Projected emissions for recreational boats were estimated based on ARB’s Off-road vehicle emission inventory model. The growth factors utilized in the OFFROAD model are prepared in a report for the Air Resources Board entitled “A Study to Develop Projected Activity for “Non-Road Mobile” Categories in California, 1970-2020”. In this report, certain economic indicators are used to project the growth in population and usage of small off-road engines in various applications. Control In 1998, the U.S. EPA began regulating exhaust emissions from marine engines (outboard motors and personal watercrafts) to reduce 75% emissions by 2025. In December of 1998, the CARB adopted standards to require cleaner engines. Beginning with 2001 models, new outboard engines, personal watercraft and jet boats must be 75% cleaner and 90% cleaner by 2008. By: Michael Nguyen Date: February, 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["commercial-aircraft-jet.html", "2.10 Commercial Aircraft, Jet", " 2.10 Commercial Aircraft, Jet 2.10.1 Emissions Introduction Considered in these categories are criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from commercial jet aircrafts during their operations at the three major airports in the Bay Area, namely, San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK), and San Jose International (SJC). A classification system for commercial aircraft was formulated consisting of major passenger, cargo, and commuter/air taxi aircraft. The major passenger aircrafts are further broken down into sub-groups of short-ranged, medium-ranged, long-ranged, and seasonal/chartered aircraft. Both the major passenger and cargo aircraft categories are primarily jet aircraft. The basic types of gas turbine engines used for commercial jet aircraft propulsion are turbojet and turbofan engines: In a turbojet engine, large quantities of air enter the engine in the front and then compressed and squeezed by the compressor before passing into the combustion chamber. This resulting mixture of fuel and air is then burned to produce hot, expanding gases. These high velocity gases pass through a turbine that is used to drive the compressor. The remaining energy in the air stream is used for aircraft propulsion. The earlier centrifugal types of compressors used in turbojets were reliable and simple, but the amount of thrust produced was relatively low because the compression ratio is not very high. These engines were also noisy and had poor fuel economy. Therefore, the quieter and more fuel-efficient turbofan engines rapidly replaced these engines. Turbofan aircraft engines power the majority of airline transports in service today. The air entering the forward end of the engine is compressed and then heated by burning fuel in the combustion chamber. The turbofan engine uses its fan to accelerate additional air around the outside of the engine (called the bypass flow) to produce a larger, slower-moving exhaust mass for efficient high subsonic propulsion. Methodology The pollutants emitted by an aircraft during take-off and landing operations are dependent on the emission rates and the duration of these operations. The emission rates are dependent upon the type of engine and its size or power rating. An aircraft operational cycle includes the landing and takeoff, or LTO cycle. For criteria pollutant emission inventory, an LTO cycle includes all normal operational modes performed by an aircraft between its descent from an altitude of about 2300 feet on landing and subsequent takeoff to reach the 2300-foot altitude. The 2300-foot limit is a reasonable approximation to the meteorological mixing depth over the Bay Area metropolitan areas. The term “operation” is used by the Federal Aviation Administration to describe either a landing or a take-off cycle. Therefore, two operations make one LTO cycle. For criteria pollutant emission calculations, the aircraft LTO cycle is divided into five segments or operational “modes” and categorized by: Landing approach (descent from about 2,300 ft. to touch down), Taxi/idle-in, Taxi/idle-out, Take-off, Climb out (ascent from lift-off to about 2,300 ft.). The emissions are based on the time of operation in each mode and the emission rates of the engines. The time in the landing approach and climbout modes are assumed to be 3.02 minutes and 1.55 minutes, respectively. Take-off time of 0.95 minute (including 0.25 minute for reverse thrust) is fairly standard for commercial aircraft and represents the time for initial climb from ground level to about 500 feet. The time in taxi/idle mode usually varies with airports. For greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventory, in addition to LTO cycle explained above, the aircraft landing approach and climb out modes above 2,300 feet elevation and aircraft cruise mode in the District’s air space is also included. The information on number of aircraft operations and fleet mix was obtained from the three major commercial airports in the Bay Area, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Metropolitan Traffic Commission (MTC). Modal emission rates for aircraft engines in commercial use were obtained from the FAA’s Aircraft Engine Emission Database, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Emission rates vary according to engine type and operating mode. Emission factors for specific aircraft were estimated by the equation: \\[ \\text{EMF} = \\text{N} \\times \\sum{\\left( v_e / v_t \\right)_{m,p}} \\times \\text{TIM} \\] where: \\(\\text{EMF}\\) = emission factor (lb/LTO); \\(\\text{N}\\) = number of engines; \\(\\left( v_e / v_t \\right)_{m,p}\\) = engine emission rates (lb/hr) at mode \\(m\\), pollutant \\(p\\); and \\(\\text{TIM}\\) = time in mode \\(m\\) (hr).

Selected years were calculated with corresponding estimates of the aircraft fleet mix during those times. Growth The continuing effort in aircraft improvement, development of newer engine technology and their phasing in will result in reduced emissions. Airport noise regulations have forced changes to the commercial aircraft fleet resulting in replacement of loud and dirtier engines with newer, quieter, and cleaner burning engines.

Methodology Fuel consumption by agriculture aircraft in the Bay Area was estimated based on number of acres sprayed and fuel used per acre. The information on estimated number of acres sprayed was obtained from the county agricultural crop reports for 1996. Total acreage for field, vegetable, fruit, nut and nursery crops were used in estimating a District total of 178,705 acres sprayed.

["on-road-motor-vehicles.html", "2.17 On Road Motor Vehicles", " 2.17 On Road Motor Vehicles 2.17.1 Emissions Introduction There are nearly 5.0 million on-road motor vehicles in the Bay Area, traveling an estimated daily average of 175 million miles. On-road motor vehicles emissions account for a large portion of the Bay Area total emissions. Realistic estimation of the emission trends from motor vehicles is an essential element of controlling and improving air quality. Methodologies To estimate emissions from a large fleet of vehicles many variables are required. The most important is the rate at which a vehicle produces various pollutants. This is usually referred to as emission factor; it varies with vehicle age, type, and operating conditions, such as speed and ambient temperature. Another important variable is called the fleet activity. This term relates to the number of in-use vehicles, number of trips and the vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The computer model for calculation of emission factors and county-specific emissions in California was developed by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). It has undergone many improvements and refinements, the latest version EMFAC2011 (Version 1.1, January 2013) was used for this inventory. It supersedes EMFAC2007, the previous version of this model, which was used for base year 2008. For a full description of the model and further supporting documentation, reference should be made to ARB’s Website at http://www.arb.ca.gov/msei/modeling.htm. Brief description of the model is given below: The new EMFAC2011 comprises a suite of three modules: EMFAC2011-LDV. The first module, named EMFAC2011-LDV, is used as the basis for estimating emissions from gasoline powered on-road vehicles, diesel vehicles below 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight rating, and urban transit buses. The algorithms used in EMFAC2011-LDV for passenger cars are the same as those used in EMFAC2007. The Bay Area activity for this module is from MTC’s activity based model “Travel Model One”, which uses ABAG’s Projection 2009 demographic/socio-economic and land use and forecasts developed and adopted in March 2009. EMFAC2011-HD. The second module, called EMFAC2011-HD, is the basis for emissions estimates for diesel trucks and buses with a gross vehicle weight rating greater than 14,000 pounds operating in California. This model is based upon the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule emissions inventory that was developed between 2007 and 2010 and approved by the Air Resources Board in December 2010. The truck and bus population and vehicle miles traveled estimates in EMFAC2011-HD are identical to those presented to the Board. Emission factors in the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule inventory were based on statewide, annual average emission factors and adjusted for improvements to fuel economy, medium-heavy duty truck emission factors, and other new information. EMFAC2011-HD emissions estimates include all of the improvements made as part of the Statewide Truck and Bus Rule inventory and then add the traditional detailed EMFAC methods that provide emission rates for annual, summer, and winter seasons on a regional basis. EMFAC2-011-SG. EMFAC2011-SG, takes the output from EMFAC2011-LDV and EMFAC2011-HD provided annual average, county-specific emissions. The module also has the ability to apply scaling factors to estimate emissions for user-defined vehicle miles of travel (VMT) and speeds. The module also provides planning inventories. Temperatures chosen for calculating these inventories are averages of ten worst air quality days (summer temperatures for high Ozone days and winter temperatures for high CO occurrences). In each case, the variation in temperature during the day is also taken into account. 2.17.2 Trends Estimates of VMT and trips for 2000-2035 were submitted by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) based on ABAG projections 2009 as described above. Prior years were unchanged from the previous estimates which were based projections of travel activity used in the 2030 Regional Transportation Plan (RTP2030). Control There are three types of controls for motor vehicle emissions: Emission Standards. Since 1972, introduction of more stringent emission standards has caused the entire motor vehicle fleet to become cleaner as newer vehicle replace the old ones. The introduction of California’s Low Emissions Vehicles Program in 1994 will ensure that this trend has continued into the present century. Most recently, regulations were adopted by ARB to reduce emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks and buses. Clean Fuels Program. This program includes Re-Formulated Gasoline Phase I (started January 1990), the Winter-time Oxygenated Fuels Program (introduced in November 1992) and Reformulated Gasoline Phase II (beginning January 1996). To reduce sulfur oxides (SOx) emissions, CARB has also regulated the sulfur content in both gasoline and diesel fuels. The latest regulations beginning 1997, reduced sulfur content of diesel fuel to 15 part per million. Inspection and Maintenance program (I/M). Also known as the Smog Check, this program was introduced in 1984. Enhancement to the original I/M were introduced in 1990, with further improvements phased in beginning 1994. In October 2003, ARB started implementing the Enhanced I/M Program (Smog Check II) in the Bay Area. As a result, further ROG, but more importantly NOx, emission reductions were achieved. More changes were made to the program mandated by State law beginning January 1, 2013. Benefits from these controls are included in the emissions estimates. In addition, there are controls to reduce motor vehicle use and congestion. These are generally referred to as Transportation Control Measures. Examples of these are programs that increase transit usage and signal timing projects. The benefits from some of these measures are included as part of the travel data (less VMT, less congested speed, etc.), and hence, already included in the emissions estimates from the relevant version of the emissions model.

["airport-ground-support-equipment.html", "2.18 Airport Ground Support Equipment", " 2.18 Airport Ground Support Equipment 2.18.1 Emissions Introduction Considered in these categories are criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from Ground Support Equipment (GSE) that service the aircraft while loading and unloading passengers and freights at the major airports in the San Francisco Bay Area. The commercial airports are San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK), and San Jose International (SJC). The Bay Area is also home to a military airbase in Solano County, the Travis Air Force Base (AFB). Examples of the equipment include baggage/aircraft tractors and tugs, ground power units, air start units, auxiliary power units, cargo belt loaders, cargo moving equipment, fuel trucks, food service trucks, and other assorted service vehicles. The majority of the equipment in use at the Bay Area commercial airport is fueled by gasoline or diesel; however, some equipment is fueled by alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), or electricity. Methodology Emissions, emission factors, equipment population and other factors such as break horsepower (BHP), load factors, typical hours of usage and equivalent ratios used are in accordance with the California Air Resources Board’s Off-Road Model 2007. Categories 1110, 1111 and 1112 account for GSE emissions from San Francisco International (SFO), Oakland International (OAK) and San Jose International (SJC) airports respectively. Travis Air Force Base GSE emissions are relatively small and no category has been assigned yet. Combined ground support equipment population for the Bay Area commercial airports is estimated to be about 1100. County Distribution Distribution of emissions into each county is based on Ground Support Equipment activity and its population in each Bay Area county. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was based on an average monthly number of aircraft operations at each airport. 2.18.2 Trends History Emissions growth through the years was estimated based on the number of aircraft operations at each airport. Growth Projections are based on combination of aircraft operations information in accordance with FAA, the Metropolitan Traffic Commission (MTC) and the San Francisco Bay Area airports.

["errata.html", "Errata", " Errata This is a very draft list of “errata”. Some are confirmed; others are suspected but not confirmed one way or the other. Right now, the list is static and mostly unsorted. (TODO: add tags and show these in a sortable, filterable table with “status”, “category”, “pollutant”, etc!) This list is hand-picked and shortened for teaching purposes. It’s intended to cover a subspace of the full gamut of issues. It is not intended to be a representative sample of the full gamut. 2.18.3 High Priority The CO2/CO ratio for category #293 Gas Fired Boilers for CY1990-2000 appears to be far too low, given what is observed for subsequent decades. (CH4/CO is also of interest) This could be resulting in the absence of 5-10 MMTCO2eq from the CY1990 BAAQMD inventory. An absence of CO2 of that magnitude, in CY1990, could be substantially distorting the answer to the key question of whether the District is “on track” to reach its CY2030 target. (Possibly related.) Emissions for #294 Oil Fired Boilers seem to be almost entirely absent from the BY2011 inventory. There are some very small emissions (~ 0.1 ton/yr of TOG and NOx) estimated for CY2008-2010, but that is it. Road Dust: The emissions for Paved Roads are flat. The paragraph under Growth states that “MTC’s CLM data show an increase of less than 2% for [1990 to 2011] (less than 0.1% per year), and this was used to create trends around the 2011 base year emissions.” However, the growth is not 2% per 20 years; it is exactly flat, because the relevant categories are all linked to profile #38 No Growth. TO BE CONTINUED… 2.18.4 Medium (or maybe Low or High) Priority General Refinery Emissions: For category #10, BY2011 NOx emissions are much lower than DataBank numbers would indicate. SOx and PM emissions, on the other hand, are consistent. For category #16 “Other”, CO2 emissions are large (~3 MMTCO2eq) and linearly increasing, which is mildly inconsistent with profiles for other pollutants in this category. Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization: TOG emission rates for two isolated years (CY1999-2000) are above 3 ton/yr. There are no estimates before CY1999. Estimates after CY2000 are exactly zero. According to the text, “Emissions for category 20 have been relatively insignificant for last few years, at less than 5 pounds per day for the entire region.” 5 lb/day is approximately 1 ton/yr, and so should be visible on the chart. The growth profile is also inconsistent with the published emission numbers. Concrete Batching: While the TSP estimates for the point-source component (category #39) align well with DataBank RY/PY data, the speciated PM10 and PM2.5 estimates are very different — on the order of hundreds of tons each year, for years CY1990-2011. This is using the BY2011 PM speciation factors, found in t0324, to derive PM10 and PM2.5 estimates from the “PM” estimates that are stored in DataBank. #305 Gas Fired Turbines shows a sharp up/down tick at CY2010. If you look at an RY pivot table, you can see that this is entirely due to one source. If you look at a PY pivot table, the effect disappears — that same source is very steady, year-over-year. It’s possible that an error existed at the time that the RY snapshot was made, but was fixed before the PY data were frozen. Animal Waste, Livestock: Table 1 in the Methodology section is inconsistent with Table 1 in the BY2011 Methodology PDF. One example: there are 28,753 sheep in Solano, with a total of 53,884 sheep District-wide. In the BY2011 Methodology PDF, those numbers are 3,804 and 28,937 respectively. The former table is created automatically from BY2011_area_source_throughput_data, itself derived from t0325. The code that produces the table is in misc_other-animal_waste-livestock.Rmd. Industrial and Commercial Coatings: Marine: Categories #1930 and #1931 are missing emission data for CY2005-2008. These aren’t zeros; there are just no rows in the BY2011-annual-A.csv file, for these categories, for CY2005-2008. Marine Loading: The paragraph under “Controls” refers to “Categories 795 - 802”, but #801 and #802 are not elsewhere mentioned, and no emissions for #801 or #802 appear in the published BY2011 inventory. Vacuum Trucks: The paragraph under “Growth” refers to a 1% growth, but the BY2011 growth profile for this category is flat. Chemical Manufacturing: Coatings and Inks: The paragraph under “Control” states that “the amended regulation has resulted in an 84% emission reduction since 1993,” but according to what’s in DataBank, the controlled fraction for category #23 seems to be 54%. Planned Agricultural Burning: Looking at category #316 Field Crops, CY2001-2008, there is a substantial “surge” in inventoried emissions. This apparent surge is on the order of hundreds of tons of most criteria pollutants. If there is reason to believe that this really happened in the world, it’s probably worth an explanation. It appears to be reflected in — or attributable to — DataBank growth profiles #726 and #727. Accidental Structural Fires: The BY2011 emission factors, pulled from DataBank, appear not to match the relevant table in the the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 10.3.1 - 2). Accidental Auto Fires: The BY2011 emission factor for TOG, pulled from DataBank, appears not to match the relevant table in the the BY2011 Methodology PDF. Accidental Vegetation Fires: The BY2011 throughputs (burned acreage), pulled from DataBank, appear not to match the relevant table in the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 10.4.1 - 2). Oil Fields: The BY2011 emission factor for CH4, pulled from DataBank for category #1575, appears not to match the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 4.21.1 - 2). Gas Fields: The BY2011 emission factor for CH4, pulled from DataBank for category #1576, appears not to match the BY2011 Methodology PDF (page 4.22.1 - 2). Sand Blasting: The paragraph under Control refers to Regulation 6 and Regulation [12-14]. It also states that “Controls can range up to 99% or higher.” However, no BY2011 control factors for the relevant categories (#42 and #1909) appear to be stored in DataBank. See DB_CTLFAC_CONCORDANCE and/or use BY(2011) %&gt;% DB_control_factors() to pull the relevant CFs. Recreational Boats: Emissions of many pollutants drop to exactly zero at five-year intervals (CY2020, 2025, 2030, …, etc.), and then return to the previous trend. Lawn &amp; Garden Equipment: For no pollutant is the projected growth, CY2011-2030, close in magnitude to the growth expressed by the assigned growth profiles. (The assigned growth profiles increase to +75% by CY2030.) Try, for example: BY2011_annual_emission_data %&gt;% filter_categories(1647:1651) %&gt;% filter_pollutants(&quot;NOx&quot;) %&gt;% chart_annual_growth_by(color = cat_id, base_year = CY(2011), flag_years = CY(2030)). TODO: check this for other OFFROAD categories (rec boats, TRUs, etc.). Also, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Transportation Refrigeration Units (TRUs): Like Lawn &amp; Garden Equipment, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Agricultural Equipment: Like TRUs, N2O emissions for a five-year interval (CY2026-2030) are exactly zero. Also, #1646 Ag Equip (Diesel) is linked to growth profile #464 Commercial Boats. (?) Construction Equipment: SO2 emissions appear spiky, particularly between CY1998-2010. Industrial Equipment: TOG emissions for #1667 (Natural Gas) exhibit the same zero-every-5-years artifact that is present in Recreational Boats, only this time it is isolated to one pollutant (TOG). Also, SO2 from #1666 (Diesel) grows much more rapidly than any other pollutant. Light Commerical Equipment: CO2 and CH4~ for #1672 (Diesel) drop to exactly zero at CY2010, then resume the previous trend. Also, N2O for #1668 (Gasoline, 4-stroke) is exactly zero for CY2026-2030 (same as rec boats, TRUs, ag equip, etc.). Off Road Motorcycles &amp; All Terrain Vehicles: Emissions for several sub-categories exhibit odd behavior at 5-year intervals, similar to the above. Ships: BY2011 categories are actually #2041:2220, not #1787:1887. TO BE CONTINUED… "],
