To achieve this process, an array of equipment is used to refine crude oil; the emissions that are generated as a byproduct from these processes make up the petroleum refining emissions categories. Emissions reported are those generated via basic refining processes/devices and do not include emissions from refinery fugitives, storage units, and combustion processes (other than flares and blow down systems). These non-included sources are accounted for in other categories of the emission inventory report. Category 10 accounts for emissions from refining processes that involve chemical reactions, such as, but not limited to cracking, polymerization, and reforming. Significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate (PM) emissions are produced during catalytic cracking and coking operations. Category 11 includes all permitted refinery oil/water separation equipment and fugitive emissions from process drains. This category also contains units such as clarifiers and dissolved air flotation systems. Category 12 accounts for emissions from treatment of wastewater at oil refineries. Category 13 contains emissions from cooling systems. Emissions from cooling towers consist of fugitive VOC’s and dissolved gases (such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia) which are leaked through heat exchangers into cooling water. The contaminants are then vaporized into the atmosphere at the cooling tower. Category 14 includes emissions from vacuum producing systems. Vacuum systems are used primarily to distill heavy crude residues which cannot be distilled at atmospheric pressure. Category 15 accounts for all refinery process gas (combustion) emissions from flares and blow down systems. Refinery flares can emit large quantities of organics, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide as well as greenhouse gases. Category 16 includes emissions from all other refinery processes not covered in category 15. Emissions of organic compounds and greenhouse gases from storage tanks, sulfur recovery units, and combustion processes are shown in sections REF, REF, and REF respectively. The processes in this category include distillation, hydrogen manufacturing plants, fuel blending. Coke loading and storage facilities account for most of the particulate emissions in this category. Methodologies Emissions for these categories are obtained from point source data in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank). Emissions are updated annually, on a source-by-source basis, using the following inputs: Process material throughputs as reported by the refineries (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by refineries or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by refineries also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county fraction and monthly/daily factors are calculated based on data obtained from the Data Bank. 2.1.2 Trends History Historic emissions have generally varied with refinery throughputs. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credit (IERC). IERC banking emissions are now inventoried separately under categories 298-301. Also, flare source emissions from categories 298 and 299 are now accounted for in category 15. Beginning in December 2003, flare emission monitoring control was implemented for all refineries in the Bay Area. Flare emissions are based upon these monitoring data. In 2010, SOx decreased significantly as a result of an abatement device installation at Valero refinery. Over 90% of SOx emissions were reduced at Valero refinery from prior years. Growth Projected growth for all refinery related categories was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2011) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to remain relatively flat. This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Future flare emissions are difficult to predict, since they are predicated on emergencies and the nature of emergencies which are unknown and unpredictable. However, with the recent passage of refinery flare monitoring and flare minimization plan requirements, flare emissions are expected to remain constant as long as there are no large upset in refinery processes that would warrant increase in flaring activities. Control Refinery emissions are regulated by the District. Regulation 6, 7, 8, and 9 regulate Particulate Matter, Odorous Substances, Organic Compounds, and Inorganic Gaseous Pollutants respectably. Regulation 12, Rule 11 and 12 pertain to flare monitoring and flare minimization plan at Petroleum Refineries. The rule does not mandate reductions. District staff has found that because refiners have looked more closely both at monitoring and the feasibility of flaring reductions, flaring activities at the five Bay Area refineries have dropped dramatically over the past years. The result has been a significant emission reduction that cannot be directly attributed to this rule, but has and will ultimately be reflected in the emissions. By: Tan Dinh Date: December 2013 Base Year: 2011 2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions 2.2.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 17, 18, and 19 contain refinery fugitive emissions from sealed equipment. These emissions are treated as point sources and are unique to each refinery. Emissions occur from process equipment whenever components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict occurrences. Valve and flange leaks account for the bulk of total fugitive emissions while pressure relief valves account for the smallest amount of total fugitive emissions. Methodologies The petroleum refineries are periodically surveyed for the number of mechanical components utilized in an oil refining process. These components include valves, PRVs, pumps, and compressor seals. Individual types of components are summed up and emissions are calculated based on throughputs and specific emission factors. Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutant, mainly total organic compounds, and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from information collected in the District’s data bank. Information such as plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation are also stored in the data bank. 2.2.2 Trends History Historical changes in fugitive emissions in the Bay Area have been due to installation of newer process units that supplement rather than replace old process units. Growth It is expected that fugitive emissions will not increase significantly in future after new units are built to produce reformulated gasoline. Control The District adopted control regulations in 1980 for valves and flanges, pump and compressor seals and PRVs. This marked the first step in the control of fugitive emissions. Control for valves vary widely, gas PRVs are 95% controlled, while heavy liquid valves have negligible control. Most common and significant emission sources are the light liquid service valves, and they are controlled by 65 to 72%. In 1997 and 1998, the District combined the three previous regulations 8-18, 8-25, and 8- 28, into a single regulation, Equipment Leaks, # 8-18. Regulation 8-25 was deleted. Regulation 8-28 was changed to focus on episodic emissions from the normal operation of pressure relief valves. During this change the leak standard for only the pressure relief valves was reduced from 10,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm of total organic compounds. In addition, applicability of the new Regulation 8-18 was broadened to include all leaking equipment, not just valves, flanges, and other equipment specifically listed in the earlier regulation. The following table summarizes the limits. FIXME: TABLE OMITTED By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 2.3 Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization 2.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions for this category are generated from depressurization of process vessels at petroleum refineries. Generally a standard procedure requires repeated purging of the process vessel with inert gasses to reduce the concentration of organic vapors to below 300 PPM, before venting a vessel to the atmosphere. Methodology These emissions are from point sources data reported annually. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the refineries. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Greenhouse gas emission factors are also provided by the individual refineries and/or taken from EPA. Emissions for greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, and N2O are reported by the refinery during the District’s annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 2.3.2 Trends History Emissions for category 20 have been relatively insignificant for last few years, at less than 5 pounds per day for the entire region. Growth Projected growth for this category is based on the throughput of marine operations. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 10 on July 20, 1983. Overall control afforded by this rule is estimated to be 95%. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["chemical-manufacturing-facilities.html", "Chapter 3 Chemical Manufacturing Facilities 3.1 Coatings &amp; Inks 3.2 Resins 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.4 All Other Chemical Plants", " Chapter 3 Chemical Manufacturing Facilities 3.1 Coatings &amp; Inks 3.1.1 Emissions Introduction Organic emissions from the manufacturing of coatings and inks are reported in this category. Coatings processes includes mixes, blends, or compounding of paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, shellac, or sealers from raw materials. Ink manufacturing involves mixes, blends or compounding other raw materials to produce the ink. Printing inks consist of pigments, which produce the desired colors, binders which lock the pigment to the substrate, and solvents, usually organic compounds that dissolve the pigments and binders. A majority of the emissions originate from mixing and cleaning operations. Throughput information of each source is reported by the facilities and is stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated by using data on the reported throughput, the specific materials ( i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as supplied by the companies through the District “S” and “G” forms. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on major coatings and inks manufacturer’s reported quarterly percent throughput. An attempt was made to weight-average into monthly factor, with March through August being the high season and November and December being the lowest. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.1.2 Trends History Emissions have been generally increasing due to increasing demand on coatings and inks, which has been about 4 to 8 percent per year in the 1980’s. District Regulation 8, Rule 35, pertaining to emissions control from mixing operations at coating and ink facilities was adopted in May 1984. Since the adoption of the regulation, there have been significant changes in the manufacturing process. It was estimated there was a 55% emission reduction due to the implementation of the regulation. Growth Projections to year 2030 was based on growth profile of ARB’s Manufacturing in the Printing Industry, and is expected to grow at a only 1-2 percent per year. Control Regulation 8, Rule 35 was amended effective January 1993, eliminating the exemptions from small users, requiring lids on all portable and stationary mixing vats, and other cleaning provisions. Control effectiveness of the amended regulation has resulted in an 84% emission reduction since 1993. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.2 Resins 3.2.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from operations performed at resin manufacturing facilities. Resin is a semi-solid, water insoluble organic material with little or no tendency to crystallize under standard temperature and atmospheric conditions. Resins are the basic components of plastics and other surface coating formulations. Equipment used in the operations and manufacturing of resins include resin reactor vessels and thinning/blending tanks. The manufacturing of resins produces mostly organic emissions. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated based on throughput data, material description (i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as reported by the companies via the Bay Area Air District’s “S” and “G” air permit forms. The District obtain each year, as necessary, updates for the data during the permit renewal process. The data is gathered on a source- by-source basis using the following criteria as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases are also produced in the manufacturing of resins. The greenhouse gas emission factors are provided by the plants and in some instances where they are not supplied, they are taken from EPA literature/publications. The monthly distribution is estimated based on data from the company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput. The county location of each company as reported in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank) is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.2.2 Trends History Emissions have increased due to increasing demand from related industries, such as plastics and coating manufacturers. District Regulation 8, Rule 36, limiting emissions from resin manufacturing operations was adopted in June 1984. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on growth profile of ARB’s Chemical Manufacturing which is expected to grow at about 2-3 percent per year for the next few years. Control It is estimated that the District achieved a 52% reduction in organic emissions due to the implementation of Regulation 8, Rule 36. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry. The emissions consisted of both point (Category 25) and area (Category 1897) source emissions. Pharmaceuticals manufacturing plants are those producing and/or blending chemicals for use in the formulation and production of pharmaceutical products. These consist of the manufacture, packaging, and sales of chemicals used as medication for humans and animals. Sources of emissions at pharmaceutical plants may come from batch process equipment, such as reactors, distillation units, extractors, centrifuges, filters, crystallizers, dryers, and storage and transfer. Several different products are manufactured at Cosmetics products facilities. Organic chemicals are used as raw materials and solvents; such as ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, etc. are used. Solvent is recovered where convenient, and as a means of cost effectiveness. Emissions from these operations are almost entirely non-methane organic solvents. There is a wide variety of products manufactured from these two industries, which may also include non-pharmaceuticals for preventive medicine and health-enhancement, medicated and non-medicated cosmetics, and food additives. Methodology The amount of solvent usage by the pharmaceutical manufacturers was estimated based on the U.S. Dept. of Commerce “Current Industrial Reports”, and the “Census of Manufacturers”. It was assumed solvent usage from the cosmetics industry was included from this estimate. Using one dollar per gallon of alcohol, the dollar estimate was converted to gallons. This amount was projected for Bay Area use with an annual growth rate of 2.6 % from 1993. It was assumed this is the total solvent usage by the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The average solvent density was assumed to be 6.6 lbs./gal. The District data bank reported point sources from several pharmaceutical companies. Throughput and other data information of each source are reported by the facilities. Emissions are calculated by using these data through the District “S” and “G” forms. It is assumed there are also a number of other smaller pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturers, known as area sources, not included in the District data bank system. Subtracting the total solvent usage estimate from the point source usage yields an area source solvent usage. An uncontrolled emission factor of 330 lbs./1000 gallons is based on a 5% loss of the usage. District Regulation 8, Rule 24, limiting organic compounds emissions from various pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturing operation took effect in July 1984 with an estimated 42% overall control. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was assumed to be uniform. County Distribution The ratio of each County’s population was used to distribute emission into counties. 3.3.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated by using the estimated solvent usage by the industry. Growth Emissions through the year 2030 are projected according to estimated growth prediction of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products industry. Approximately 0.8% per year of growth is expected in the next few years. Control Efforts are being made to streamline and standardize rules and regulations. Any subsequent refinement in Regulation 8, Rule 24 due to this streamlining should not have any effect on the controls, and therefore the controls for this rule will remain at 42%. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.4 All Other Chemical Plants Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid Manufacturing Facilities (#21, #22) All Other Chemical Plants Point Source Emissions (#26) Fugitive Emissions at Chemical Plants (#27) 3.4.1 Emissions Introduction Category 21 contains emissions from sulfur recovery units and sulfur storage at refineries and chemical plants. Category 22 contains emissions from sulfuric acid storage tanks at refineries and chemical plants. The emissions of concern from these categories are sulfur dioxide. Abatement devices to treat sulfur recovery units’ tail gas and sulfur dioxide scrubbers at sulfuric acid manufacturing plants have significantly reduced the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted. The emissions data shows that without the District’s controls, 150 tons per day of sulfur dioxide would have been emitted in to the atmosphere instead of approximately 3 tons per day. Category 26 contains all other chemical plant point source emissions. Some of these sources include acid manufacturing plants, kiln burners, and specialty chemicals manufacturing plants. Emissions caused by the combustion of fuels at chemical plants are not accounted for in this category. Category 27 contains fugitive emissions at chemical plants. Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are potential sources that can leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict. In addition, these emissions may be intermittent and vary in intensity over time. According to EPA report (EPA-625/10-84-004, Dec. 1984) 35% of the total emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities are emitted as fugitive emissions. Methodologies These categories contain both point and area source emissions from chemical plants in the District. Most of the emissions (point sources) from chemical plants are accounted for through our permitting processes, however, Category 27 fugitive emissions (area sources) are not. Fugitive emissions for Category 27 were taken as 35% of the total organic emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities (Categories 21 through 26) within the District. The number of equipment components was used as throughput. Emissions for Categories 21, 22, and 26 were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source- by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced in the chemical plant processes. Since these emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. Monthly Variation and County Distribution The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 3.4.2 Trends History In general, emissions increase as throughputs increase. In addition to usage changes, new installations also increase the emissions. Overall emissions for these categories did not significantly increase in last eight years. Growth The projected growths in these categories are taken from expected growth in manufacturing employment over the region to the year 2030. The employment data was obtained from the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 “Projections” reports. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 22 on March 5, 1980. The control afforded by this rule is estimated to be 60%, with rule effectiveness at 98% for an overall control rate of 59%. This rule only affects fugitive emissions at chemical manufacturing facilities. Regulation 9 also controls non-organic emissions from many of the manufacturing plants in these categories. For example, the District amended Regulation 9, Rule 1 in 1983, 1992, and 1995 for sulfur dioxide limits at sulfur recovery systems and sulfuric acid plants. Regulation 9 also sets limits on hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
