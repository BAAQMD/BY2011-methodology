To achieve this process, an array of equipment is used to refine crude oil; the emissions that are generated as a byproduct from these processes make up the petroleum refining emissions categories. Emissions reported are those generated via basic refining processes/devices and do not include emissions from refinery fugitives, storage units, and combustion processes (other than flares and blow down systems). These non-included sources are accounted for in other categories of the emission inventory report. Category 10 accounts for emissions from refining processes that involve chemical reactions, such as, but not limited to cracking, polymerization, and reforming. Significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate (PM) emissions are produced during catalytic cracking and coking operations. Category 11 includes all permitted refinery oil/water separation equipment and fugitive emissions from process drains. This category also contains units such as clarifiers and dissolved air flotation systems. Category 12 accounts for emissions from treatment of wastewater at oil refineries. Category 13 contains emissions from cooling systems. Emissions from cooling towers consist of fugitive VOC’s and dissolved gases (such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia) which are leaked through heat exchangers into cooling water. The contaminants are then vaporized into the atmosphere at the cooling tower. Category 14 includes emissions from vacuum producing systems. Vacuum systems are used primarily to distill heavy crude residues which cannot be distilled at atmospheric pressure. Category 15 accounts for all refinery process gas (combustion) emissions from flares and blow down systems. Refinery flares can emit large quantities of organics, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide as well as greenhouse gases. Category 16 includes emissions from all other refinery processes not covered in category 15. Emissions of organic compounds and greenhouse gases from storage tanks, sulfur recovery units, and combustion processes are shown in sections REF, REF, and REF respectively. The processes in this category include distillation, hydrogen manufacturing plants, fuel blending. Coke loading and storage facilities account for most of the particulate emissions in this category. Methodologies Emissions for these categories are obtained from point source data in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank). Emissions are updated annually, on a source-by-source basis, using the following inputs: Process material throughputs as reported by the refineries (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by refineries or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by refineries also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county fraction and monthly/daily factors are calculated based on data obtained from the Data Bank. 2.1.2 Trends History Historic emissions have generally varied with refinery throughputs. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credit (IERC). IERC banking emissions are now inventoried separately under categories 298-301. Also, flare source emissions from categories 298 and 299 are now accounted for in category 15. Beginning in December 2003, flare emission monitoring control was implemented for all refineries in the Bay Area. Flare emissions are based upon these monitoring data. In 2010, SOx decreased significantly as a result of an abatement device installation at Valero refinery. Over 90% of SOx emissions were reduced at Valero refinery from prior years. Growth Projected growth for all refinery related categories was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2011) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to remain relatively flat. This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Future flare emissions are difficult to predict, since they are predicated on emergencies and the nature of emergencies which are unknown and unpredictable. However, with the recent passage of refinery flare monitoring and flare minimization plan requirements, flare emissions are expected to remain constant as long as there are no large upset in refinery processes that would warrant increase in flaring activities. Control Refinery emissions are regulated by the District. Regulation 6, 7, 8, and 9 regulate Particulate Matter, Odorous Substances, Organic Compounds, and Inorganic Gaseous Pollutants respectably. Regulation 12, Rule 11 and 12 pertain to flare monitoring and flare minimization plan at Petroleum Refineries. The rule does not mandate reductions. District staff has found that because refiners have looked more closely both at monitoring and the feasibility of flaring reductions, flaring activities at the five Bay Area refineries have dropped dramatically over the past years. The result has been a significant emission reduction that cannot be directly attributed to this rule, but has and will ultimately be reflected in the emissions. By: Tan Dinh Date: December 2013 Base Year: 2011 2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions 2.2.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 17, 18, and 19 contain refinery fugitive emissions from sealed equipment. These emissions are treated as point sources and are unique to each refinery. Emissions occur from process equipment whenever components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict occurrences. Valve and flange leaks account for the bulk of total fugitive emissions while pressure relief valves account for the smallest amount of total fugitive emissions. Methodologies The petroleum refineries are periodically surveyed for the number of mechanical components utilized in an oil refining process. These components include valves, PRVs, pumps, and compressor seals. Individual types of components are summed up and emissions are calculated based on throughputs and specific emission factors. Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutant, mainly total organic compounds, and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from information collected in the District’s data bank. Information such as plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation are also stored in the data bank. 2.2.2 Trends History Historical changes in fugitive emissions in the Bay Area have been due to installation of newer process units that supplement rather than replace old process units. Growth It is expected that fugitive emissions will not increase significantly in future after new units are built to produce reformulated gasoline. Control The District adopted control regulations in 1980 for valves and flanges, pump and compressor seals and PRVs. This marked the first step in the control of fugitive emissions. Control for valves vary widely, gas PRVs are 95% controlled, while heavy liquid valves have negligible control. Most common and significant emission sources are the light liquid service valves, and they are controlled by 65 to 72%. In 1997 and 1998, the District combined the three previous regulations 8-18, 8-25, and 8- 28, into a single regulation, Equipment Leaks, # 8-18. Regulation 8-25 was deleted. Regulation 8-28 was changed to focus on episodic emissions from the normal operation of pressure relief valves. During this change the leak standard for only the pressure relief valves was reduced from 10,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm of total organic compounds. In addition, applicability of the new Regulation 8-18 was broadened to include all leaking equipment, not just valves, flanges, and other equipment specifically listed in the earlier regulation. The following table summarizes the limits. FIXME: TABLE OMITTED By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 2.3 Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization 2.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions for this category are generated from depressurization of process vessels at petroleum refineries. Generally a standard procedure requires repeated purging of the process vessel with inert gasses to reduce the concentration of organic vapors to below 300 PPM, before venting a vessel to the atmosphere. Methodology These emissions are from point sources data reported annually. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the refineries. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Greenhouse gas emission factors are also provided by the individual refineries and/or taken from EPA. Emissions for greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, and N2O are reported by the refinery during the District’s annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 2.3.2 Trends History Emissions for category 20 have been relatively insignificant for last few years, at less than 5 pounds per day for the entire region. Growth Projected growth for this category is based on the throughput of marine operations. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 10 on July 20, 1983. Overall control afforded by this rule is estimated to be 95%. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["chemical-manufacturing-facilities.html", "Chapter 3 Chemical Manufacturing Facilities 3.1 Coatings &amp; Inks 3.2 Resins 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.4 All Other Chemical Plants", " Chapter 3 Chemical Manufacturing Facilities 3.1 Coatings &amp; Inks 3.1.1 Emissions Introduction Organic emissions from the manufacturing of coatings and inks are reported in this category. Coatings processes includes mixes, blends, or compounding of paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, shellac, or sealers from raw materials. Ink manufacturing involves mixes, blends or compounding other raw materials to produce the ink. Printing inks consist of pigments, which produce the desired colors, binders which lock the pigment to the substrate, and solvents, usually organic compounds that dissolve the pigments and binders. A majority of the emissions originate from mixing and cleaning operations. Throughput information of each source is reported by the facilities and is stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated by using data on the reported throughput, the specific materials ( i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as supplied by the companies through the District “S” and “G” forms. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on major coatings and inks manufacturer’s reported quarterly percent throughput. An attempt was made to weight-average into monthly factor, with March through August being the high season and November and December being the lowest. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.1.2 Trends History Emissions have been generally increasing due to increasing demand on coatings and inks, which has been about 4 to 8 percent per year in the 1980’s. District Regulation 8, Rule 35, pertaining to emissions control from mixing operations at coating and ink facilities was adopted in May 1984. Since the adoption of the regulation, there have been significant changes in the manufacturing process. It was estimated there was a 55% emission reduction due to the implementation of the regulation. Growth Projections to year 2030 was based on growth profile of ARB’s Manufacturing in the Printing Industry, and is expected to grow at a only 1-2 percent per year. Control Regulation 8, Rule 35 was amended effective January 1993, eliminating the exemptions from small users, requiring lids on all portable and stationary mixing vats, and other cleaning provisions. Control effectiveness of the amended regulation has resulted in an 84% emission reduction since 1993. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.2 Resins 3.2.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from operations performed at resin manufacturing facilities. Resin is a semi-solid, water insoluble organic material with little or no tendency to crystallize under standard temperature and atmospheric conditions. Resins are the basic components of plastics and other surface coating formulations. Equipment used in the operations and manufacturing of resins include resin reactor vessels and thinning/blending tanks. The manufacturing of resins produces mostly organic emissions. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated based on throughput data, material description (i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as reported by the companies via the Bay Area Air District’s “S” and “G” air permit forms. The District obtain each year, as necessary, updates for the data during the permit renewal process. The data is gathered on a source- by-source basis using the following criteria as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases are also produced in the manufacturing of resins. The greenhouse gas emission factors are provided by the plants and in some instances where they are not supplied, they are taken from EPA literature/publications. The monthly distribution is estimated based on data from the company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput. The county location of each company as reported in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank) is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.2.2 Trends History Emissions have increased due to increasing demand from related industries, such as plastics and coating manufacturers. District Regulation 8, Rule 36, limiting emissions from resin manufacturing operations was adopted in June 1984. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on growth profile of ARB’s Chemical Manufacturing which is expected to grow at about 2-3 percent per year for the next few years. Control It is estimated that the District achieved a 52% reduction in organic emissions due to the implementation of Regulation 8, Rule 36. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry. The emissions consisted of both point (Category 25) and area (Category 1897) source emissions. Pharmaceuticals manufacturing plants are those producing and/or blending chemicals for use in the formulation and production of pharmaceutical products. These consist of the manufacture, packaging, and sales of chemicals used as medication for humans and animals. Sources of emissions at pharmaceutical plants may come from batch process equipment, such as reactors, distillation units, extractors, centrifuges, filters, crystallizers, dryers, and storage and transfer. Several different products are manufactured at Cosmetics products facilities. Organic chemicals are used as raw materials and solvents; such as ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, etc. are used. Solvent is recovered where convenient, and as a means of cost effectiveness. Emissions from these operations are almost entirely non-methane organic solvents. There is a wide variety of products manufactured from these two industries, which may also include non-pharmaceuticals for preventive medicine and health-enhancement, medicated and non-medicated cosmetics, and food additives. Methodology The amount of solvent usage by the pharmaceutical manufacturers was estimated based on the U.S. Dept. of Commerce “Current Industrial Reports”, and the “Census of Manufacturers”. It was assumed solvent usage from the cosmetics industry was included from this estimate. Using one dollar per gallon of alcohol, the dollar estimate was converted to gallons. This amount was projected for Bay Area use with an annual growth rate of 2.6 % from 1993. It was assumed this is the total solvent usage by the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The average solvent density was assumed to be 6.6 lbs./gal. The District data bank reported point sources from several pharmaceutical companies. Throughput and other data information of each source are reported by the facilities. Emissions are calculated by using these data through the District “S” and “G” forms. It is assumed there are also a number of other smaller pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturers, known as area sources, not included in the District data bank system. Subtracting the total solvent usage estimate from the point source usage yields an area source solvent usage. An uncontrolled emission factor of 330 lbs./1000 gallons is based on a 5% loss of the usage. District Regulation 8, Rule 24, limiting organic compounds emissions from various pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturing operation took effect in July 1984 with an estimated 42% overall control. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was assumed to be uniform. County Distribution The ratio of each County’s population was used to distribute emission into counties. 3.3.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated by using the estimated solvent usage by the industry. Growth Emissions through the year 2030 are projected according to estimated growth prediction of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products industry. Approximately 0.8% per year of growth is expected in the next few years. Control Efforts are being made to streamline and standardize rules and regulations. Any subsequent refinement in Regulation 8, Rule 24 due to this streamlining should not have any effect on the controls, and therefore the controls for this rule will remain at 42%. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 3.4 All Other Chemical Plants Sulfur and Sulfuric Acid Manufacturing Facilities (#21, #22) All Other Chemical Plants Point Source Emissions (#26) Fugitive Emissions at Chemical Plants (#27) 3.4.1 Emissions Introduction Category 21 contains emissions from sulfur recovery units and sulfur storage at refineries and chemical plants. Category 22 contains emissions from sulfuric acid storage tanks at refineries and chemical plants. The emissions of concern from these categories are sulfur dioxide. Abatement devices to treat sulfur recovery units’ tail gas and sulfur dioxide scrubbers at sulfuric acid manufacturing plants have significantly reduced the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted. The emissions data shows that without the District’s controls, 150 tons per day of sulfur dioxide would have been emitted in to the atmosphere instead of approximately 3 tons per day. Category 26 contains all other chemical plant point source emissions. Some of these sources include acid manufacturing plants, kiln burners, and specialty chemicals manufacturing plants. Emissions caused by the combustion of fuels at chemical plants are not accounted for in this category. Category 27 contains fugitive emissions at chemical plants. Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are potential sources that can leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict. In addition, these emissions may be intermittent and vary in intensity over time. According to EPA report (EPA-625/10-84-004, Dec. 1984) 35% of the total emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities are emitted as fugitive emissions. Methodologies These categories contain both point and area source emissions from chemical plants in the District. Most of the emissions (point sources) from chemical plants are accounted for through our permitting processes, however, Category 27 fugitive emissions (area sources) are not. Fugitive emissions for Category 27 were taken as 35% of the total organic emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities (Categories 21 through 26) within the District. The number of equipment components was used as throughput. Emissions for Categories 21, 22, and 26 were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source- by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced in the chemical plant processes. Since these emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. Monthly Variation and County Distribution The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 3.4.2 Trends History In general, emissions increase as throughputs increase. In addition to usage changes, new installations also increase the emissions. Overall emissions for these categories did not significantly increase in last eight years. Growth The projected growths in these categories are taken from expected growth in manufacturing employment over the region to the year 2030. The employment data was obtained from the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 “Projections” reports. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 22 on March 5, 1980. The control afforded by this rule is estimated to be 60%, with rule effectiveness at 98% for an overall control rate of 59%. This rule only affects fugitive emissions at chemical manufacturing facilities. Regulation 9 also controls non-organic emissions from many of the manufacturing plants in these categories. For example, the District amended Regulation 9, Rule 1 in 1983, 1992, and 1995 for sulfur dioxide limits at sulfur recovery systems and sulfuric acid plants. Regulation 9 also sets limits on hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Bread is produced either by sponge-dough process, brews (or liquid sponges) process, or straight-dough process. Commercial bakeries more often use the sponge-dough process, where ingredients are initially mixed, bread dough fermented from 3 to 5 hours, and then baked in ovens at about 450 °F. Bakery products such as sweet rolls, crackers, pretzels, cakes, cookies, doughnuts, biscuits, etc. are either leavened by yeast or by baking powder. Yeast metabolizes the sugars and starches in the dough during fermentation process. The end product of this chemical reaction is primarily carbon dioxide and ethanol (TOG). The major criteria pollutant emitted from bread baking is primarily ethanol, which is a by-product of the leavening process. Emissions of combustion products from the burning of fuel in the ovens stacks are not considered in this category. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is calculated from the combustion of the ethanol from the bread in an abatement device such as an afterburner. The abatement devices are used on the larger (point source) ovens. There is no CO2 emission data from the fermentation process available at this time. 4.1.1 Methodologies Throughput information from large bakeries are reported and stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Source tests, which are conducted at various times, provide the data for criteria pollutant emission factors. (During the rulemaking process in the late 1980’s, fifteen ovens from six large bakeries in the Bay Area were source tested by the District. Ethanol (TOG) emissions ranged from 0.3 to 7.0 pounds per thousand pounds bread produced, depending on the oven size, operating temperature, and type of product.) As mentioned above, CO2 emissions are estimated from the combustion of ethanol from the bread in an abatement device. Emissions from these larger bakeries are called point sources (Category #28). There are numerous smaller bakeries in the Bay Area, which are not in the Data Bank system. These bakeries use smaller ovens. Source test results showed an emission factor of 5.4 pounds ethanol per ton of bread produced. Emissions from these smaller bakeries are called area sources (Category #935). Throughput data for small bakeries was based on a survey regarding the large bakeries. Small bakeries showed an approximately 37% share of the total bread market. The 2011 average daily throughput from smaller bakeries was calculated to be about 79,676 tons/year. TOG emissions from small bakeries were 1,179 pounds/day (0.59 ton per day) Monthly Variation For large bakeries, monthly distribution was based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. For small bakeries (area sources), monthly distribution was based on a 1990 production of a large bakery, which is assumed to be typical. County Distribution The county locations and associated emissions of each of the large bakeries were used to distribute countywide emissions. For small bakeries, the number of employees in the large bakeries was subtracted from the total number of employees in each county’s bakeries. This data was found in the U.S Census Department’s 2010 County Business Patterns 4.1.2 Trends 4.1.2.1 History Historical emissions were estimated using actual throughputs and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile. District Regulation 8, Rule 42 set standards for new and modified bakery ovens on large commercial bakeries effective January of 1989. Growth Emissions projections to 2030 were also based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile. Control District Regulation 8, Rule 42 was amended requiring control equipment for existing ovens, which commenced operation prior to January 1989. This became effective beginning January 1992. Currently, there is an estimated 82% overall control (for large bakeries) on TOG emissions because of this rule. By: Stuart Schultz Date: October 2013 Base Year 2011 4.2 Cooking, Charbroiling, Deep Fat Frying, and Unspecified (Griddles) 4.2.1 Emissions Introduction This category includes particulate and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from the preparation of food for human consumption at eating establishments. Carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, is also emitted from cooking process in these three categories. Restaurant equipment that contributes to these emissions includes charbroilers (Category 29), deep fat fryers (Category 1710) and griddles (Category 1711). Charbroilers can either be conveyorized or under-fire; both types generally use natural gas, however, under-fire charbroilers may use solid fuels, such as charcoal or wood. Deep-fat fryers may be either gas-fired or electric to heat the cooking oil used to cook the food. Griddles use an exposed metal plate, heated by either gas or electricity, to cook the food. These categories do not include the products of combustion emissions from fuel usage (i.e. natural gas or solid fuels) at these establishments. Those emissions can be found in Categories 307, 1590, or 312. Methodology The District estimated the number of restaurants in operation in the Bay Area with assistance from each county’s health department. Each county health department provided the number of restaurants permitted within their jurisdiction. The District refined the number of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that are less likely to cook, such as delicatessens and ice cream parlors. The District used a 1997 South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) report, “Staff Recommendations Regarding Controlling Emissions from Restaurant Operations”, to estimate the number of charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles used in the Bay Area. The SCAQMD report surveyed the type of equipment that was used in restaurant cooking operations in their district boundaries. This report found approximately 33% of the restaurants operates under-fired charbroilers, 4% operate chain-driven charbroilers, 62% operate deep fat fryers, and 52% operate griddles. The average amount of food cooked on each type of appliance was developed for the California Air Resources Board by the Public Research Institute. Emission factors, developed by the University of California at Riverside and the University of Minnesota, were used to quantify the emissions each type of food cooked on charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles. Total District throughputs for each type of food for each device were calculated by multiplying the amount of food cooked by the number of restaurants with that particular cooking device. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the emission factor by the throughput. The total organic gas (TOG) emitted from these three categories is considered all reactive (i.e. TOG equals ROG). The PM emissions emitted from these three categories are particulate matter less than 10 microns in size (PM10) since it is assumed all particles larger than 10 microns are captured before the outside exhaust. A portion of these PM10 emissions are in the form of condensable vapors. Condensable are vapors in the gaseous form at entry into the ventilation hood, but may condense into particulate form (i.e. liquid or solid state) in the duct works, as it exits the exhaust fan, or in the atmosphere. At the time of this writing, condensable PM is not included in the particulate calculations for these categories. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on seasonal variation of each establishment, which is a higher sale during summer months due to longer daylight hours and warmer weather. County Distribution The number of eating establishments in each county was based on data provided by each of the Bay Area’s county health department. The District refined these numbers of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that were less likely to cook. 4.2.2 Trends History Emissions back to 1996 were estimated based on historical number of eating establishments in the Bay Area as reported in the “Taxable Sales in California (Sales &amp; Use Tax) publications. Prior to 1996 the emissions were based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Control On December 5, 2007, the District adopted Regulation 6, Rule 2, Commercial Cooking Equipment, to reduce particulate and VOC emissions from commercial cooking equipment. Effective January 1, 2009, chain-driven charbroilers that cook at least 400 pounds of beef per week are required to operate with a certified catalytic oxidizer to control emissions of both PM and VOC. Effective January 1, 2010, any newly installed under-fired charbroiler that has a grill surface area of at least 10 square feet and cooks at least 800 pounds of beef per week will be required to install a control device to reduce PM10 emissions to no more than 1 pound of PM10 per 1000 pounds of beef cooked. . Effective January 1, 2013, any existing restaurant having an under-fired charbroiler that has a grill surface area of at least 10 square feet and cooks at least 800 pounds of beef per week will be required to install a control device to reduce PM10 emissions by the same amount. These charbroilers (chain-driven and under-fired) must also be registered through the District By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 4.3 Wineries/Breweries - Fermentation 4.3.1 Emissions Introduction This category accounts for the ethanol emissions resulting from the fermentation of grapes at wineries located in the Bay Area. During the fermentation process, sugar in the grape juice reacts with yeast to form ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Ethanol is emitted into the atmosphere through evaporation. The amount of ethanol formation is dependent on tank design, length of fermentation period, fermentation temperature, and volume and sugar content of fermenting juice. Sugar content is measured as degrees Brix (grams sugar/100 ml. juice). Methodology Wine production in the Bay Area was estimated based on ARB’s methodology and Wine Institute‘s Grape Crush report. Ethanol emission factors from the two types of wine (White and Red) were derived by the ARB from a computer model developed by Williams and Boulton. The ethanol emission factors per thousand gallons of wine produced for white wine, rose wine, and red wine are listed below: White wine: 2.5 lbs. Rose and Red wine: 6.2 lbs. Using an estimated production of wine as: 41.5% white and 58.5% red wine, a composite emission factor of 4.7 lbs. per thousand gallon of wine produced was derived. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor was derived from the chemical equation. \\[ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + \\text{yeast} \\rightarrow 2\\ C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2\\ CO_{2} \\] Assume that fifty percent of CO2 emissions escaped to atmosphere during fermentation process, the CO2 emission factor of 157.41 lbs. per thousands of gallons of wine was estimated. District’s Regulations 3, adopted on May 21, 2008, defined the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wine fermentation processes was biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The total emissions for this category are determined by multiplying the emission factor and the wine production. This methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5.1). Emissions from point sources are calculated from operating data (throughput, emission factors, control factors, if any, etc.) submitted for each equipment as part of the permit process. This operating data is updated upon renewal of the permit. Monthly Variation The ethanol emissions associated with wine fermentation occurs during the grape crushing season, which generally runs from mid-August through October. County Distribution County distribution was based on the amount of wine production in each county. Alameda, Contra Costa, Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma Counties were assumed to produce wine. 4.3.2 Trends History Prior to Base Year 2005, the throughput had been obtained from the “Final Grape Crush Report” published by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Although phylloxera bugs attack vine rootstock, the wine production in vineyards increased at moderate rate in 1996. ARB revised Winery methodology in September 2004 to reflect current wine production in California. The historical throughput data between 2004 and 2010 were obtained from the Wine Institute located in San Francisco Growth Past and future projection of emissions was based on the food manufacturing industries taken from ABAG’s 2009 Projections report. By: Michael Nguyen Date: January, 2014 Base Year 2011 4.4 Wineries/Breweries - Aging 4.4.1 Emissions Introduction This category consists of both area and point sources. The area source accounts for the ethanol emissions from aging of brandy. Brandy is produced from a distillation process, separating ethanol and other volatile substances from fermented juices. The brandy is then aged for a period of two to ten years. During the aging process, usually, in 50-gallon oak barrels, there is a considerable amount of ethanol emissions released from the barrels into the atmosphere. The point source portion accounts for organic emissions from brewery sources contained in the District’s Data Bank. Methodology San Joaquin Valley District estimated 4,561,546 gallons of brandy in 2007. The 57,380 barrels of Brandy in Bay Area were estimated based upon the above reported data. An emission factor for a 50-gallon Brandy barrel was derived by the Wine Institute. The assumption being: brandy is 120 proof (60% alcohol) on the average; and alcohol is lost during aging at a rate of 2.5% per year per barrel. This resulted in an emission factor of 4.96 lbs. ethanol per barrel of Brandy. Emissions calculations from the aging of brandy consist of multiplying the emission factor with the amount of brandy barrels in storage in the District. The methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5-2). Monthly Variation Brandy is aged for a period of years, during which emissions are released 365 days per year and 24 hours per day. County Distribution County distribution is based on the number of 50-gallon brandy barrels in each county. Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties are assumed to produce or to store the 50-gallon brandy barrels. 4.4.2 Trends History From 1980 to 1987, estimated emissions were based on the summary report of the number of alcoholic production facilities in California published by U.S. Department of Census. The number of alcoholic production facilities had been reduced in Santa Clara County due to increasing new electronic manufacturers and housing development. However, grape production has increased since 1988; therefore, emissions were estimated to be at constant level during 1988-1990. In 1993, grape crush was down approximately 7 % from the 1992 crush, and 7 % less than the record-large 1982 crush of 3,115,531 tons. Emissions from 1993 to 1998 are assumed to be constant at the 1993 production level. Growth Future projection of emissions was based on the food manufacturing industries taken from ABAG’s 2009 Projections report. By: Michael Nguyen Date: January, 2014 Base Year 2011 4.5 Other Food &amp; Agricultural Processing 4.5.1 Emissions Introduction The category includes emissions from processing plants of miscellaneous food and agricultural products for human or animal consumption such as: coffee and cocoa bean roasting; grain feed milling/packaging; spice/flavoring handling; sugar refinery; onion, garlic, corn, and pet food processing. Methodology This category consists only of point sources that are contained in the District Data Bank system. Individual companies report information on plant equipment, operating data, and source throughput. This information is updated upon permit renewal in the District’s Data Bank. Criteria pollutant emissions calculated by using throughput data of the specific materials, emission factors based on various test data and publications, operating times, batch cycle variables, and control equipment reduction factors. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are produced during the fermentation process of beer production and in the combustion of organic emissions from coffee and cocoa beans in abatement devices, such as an afterburner. The CO2 emissions emitted from beer production is considered biogenic. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated to be the same throughout the year due to the variety of processing facilities. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county. 4.5.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1987) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment data. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment data. Control Emissions through the years were estimated by using agricultural production data in the District. In 1963-1964 there was at least 50% reduction of particulate emissions from equipment such as coffee roaster and food dryers brought about by the District’s Regulation 6 on visible emissions from the Ringlemann 2 standard. In 1970 there was at least an additional 25% reduction in particulates from the Ringlemann 1 standard. Currently, there is an estimated 98% overall control of particulates from this category.

Foundry &amp; Forging Operations) (34) Foundry &amp; Forging Operations, Fugitive (2221) Metal Recycling &amp; Shredding Operations (2222) Metal Recycling &amp; Shredding Operations, Fugitive (2223) 4.6.1 Emissions Introduction Foundries, forging operations, and metal recycling and shredding operations are sources of particulate matter (PM) emissions, some of which may be listed as toxic air contaminants, and total organic compounds (TOG), some of which may also be odorous compounds. Foundries and forges process ferrous (iron based) metals, non-ferrous (i.e. aluminum, copper, magnesium, zinc, brass, and bronze), or a combination of both. Metal recycling and shredding facilities collect, sort, and recycle scrap metal. Scrap Metal includes both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and is often shredded. Point sources (Categories 34 and 2222) include various process equipment associated with the foundry, forging and metal recycling and shredding operations. These equipment include furnaces (cupola, electric arc, reverberatory, etc.), temporary mold and core making, metal casting, cooling, shakeout, and sand reclamation, shredders, etc. These equipment are subject to District regulations and the permit system. However, there may be some exempt sources for which permits are not required that are also considered point sources. Emissions associated with these two categories are PM and TOG. In addition to point sources, various other processes and emission sources at these facilities, such as tapping pouring and casting, cooling, shakeout, metal management, sorting separation, open spaces, etc. are the primary sources of fugitive emissions. The fugitive PM emissions from these processes and sources are considered area sources (Categories 2221 and 2223). Methodology Categories 34 and 2222 contain PM and TOG emissions from point sources only. These point source emissions are calculated from operating data submitted for each equipment as part of the permit approval process. Parameters and variables include throughput, emission factors, operating times, batch cycle variables, and stack parameters. For control equipment, the weight percent reduction factors for each pollutant account for emission reduction. Throughput is updated upon permit renewal. The PM and TOG emissions for the point sources are contained in the permit data bank and the summation of these emissions provide the emissions for these categories. Categories 2221 and 2223 contain PM emissions from area sources. Fugitive PM emissions from Category 2221 were estimated using a BAAQMD engineering analysis of PM emission at four of the larger foundries and forges within the District The fugitive PM emissions at three of these facilities were estimated to be between 60% - 85% of the total (fugitive and abated) PM emissions. The fugitive PM emission at other facility, though small, was estimated from its recycling activity. The fugitive emissions and throughput from these facilities were used to estimate an emission factor. This emission factor along with reported throughputs from the smaller foundries and forging facilities within the District provided fugitive PM emissions from these sources. In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2221 was estimated to be 0.61 ton/day. District staff used an engineering analysis of fugitive PM emissions from a recent CEQA analysis conducted for a new facility in West Sacramento, California to estimate fugitive PM emissions from Bay Area scrap metal recycling facilities (Category 2223). In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2223 was estimated to be 0.12 ton/day. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions for these categories is assumed to be uniform (i.e. does not vary) throughout the year. County Distribution For point and area sources, information on the location of each facility was known and the emissions were distributed to the counties accordingly. 4.6.2 Trends History The historical growth profiles were based on a combination of prior emissions data and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment growth profile. Control In 1963-1970, the particulate emissions were reduced due to the control imposed by Ringlemann requirements from Regulation 6. Currently, there is an estimated 98.5% overall control of particulates from Category 34 and over 99% for Category 2222. On May 1, 2013, Regulation 12, Rule 13 (Miscellaneous Standards of Performance, Foundry and Forging Operations) was passed. For Category 34, organics will be reduced by approximately 42%, beginning May 1, 2015. For Category 2221, this rule will reduce fugitive particulate emissions by approximately 10% through an Emission Minimization Plan, beginning May 1, 2015. On May 1, 2013, Regulation 6, Rule 4 (Metal recycling and Shredding Operations) was passed. For Category 2223, this rule will reduce fugitive particulate emissions by approximately 24% through an Emission Minimization Plan, beginning May 1, 2015. By: Stuart Schultz Date: February 2014 Base Year 2011 4.7 Wood Products Manufacturing 4.7.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from this category include generation of small wood waste particles (sawdust) from woodworking operations such as sawing, planing, lathing, and sanding. Industries engaged on these operations include manufacturers of plywood, particleboard, hard board, and furniture. Methodology This category contains emissions from both point (Category 35) and area sources (Category 1907). Wood waste generated as particulate matter is removed from the wood working operations mainly for housekeeping purposes, by either a cyclone or a baghouse. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plant by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The point sources account for the majority of emissions from this category. It was estimated that area sources account for 20% of the total throughput from this category. The area source total particulate emission factor was assumed to be 20 pounds/ton wood processed. Area source particulate emissions were calculated by multiplying the throughput by its emission factor. 4.7.1.1 Monthly Variation The emissions over the 12 months were estimated based on the throughput data from each plant. 4.7.1.2 County Distribution Emissions are distributed to the counties based on the location of the processing plant. The District’s data bank contains the information on plant location. 4.7.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior permit data (back to 1990) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile. By: Stuart Schultz Date: November 2013 Base Year 2011 4.8 Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion 4.8.1 Emissions Introduction The primary criteria pollutant emission from cement manufacturing is particulate matter. Particulate matter at cement plants are generated during quarrying, crushing, grinding, blending, drying, transfer process, and storage of cement. The largest single source of emissions is the kiln. The cement industry generally uses mechanical collectors, electric precipitators, or baghouses to control emissions. The most desirable method of disposing of the dust collected by an emission control system is injection into kiln burning zone for inclusion in the clinker. Various fuels are used in the kiln for the cement manufacturing process. These fuels have included coke, coal, and natural gas. (As of 2010, coal was no longer as a fuel in the kiln.) Diesel fuel is used in the emergency generators and portable compressors. The emissions from these fuels are the five criteria pollutants, namely PM, organics, NOx, SOx, and CO. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), is also produced during the cement manufacturing process. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the GHG’s emitted during the combustion of the fuels. Methodology These categories contain criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from point sources only. Emissions were individually calculated for each source operation in the District’s Data Bank System. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the specific emission factor for a particular source operation by the throughput. These data are supplied by the permitted facility. The summation of these emissions provides the emissions for these categories. The CO2 emission factor used in the cement manufacturing process was obtained from the California Climate Action Registry’s Cement reporting Protocol. The combustion sources (coke, natural gas. and diesel) GHG emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O were obtained from the Department of Energy (EIA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC). Monthly Variation Monthly and daily production rates follow permitted data supplied by the major cement manufacturer. County Distribution Emissions are distributed to the county based on the location of the processing plant. The District’s data bank contains the information on plant location in Santa Clara County 4.8.2 Trends History The historical growth profile for Category 36 was based on a combination of prior cement kiln throughput data (back to 1987) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. The historical growth profile for Categories 1747 - 1750 was based on a combination of prior fuel throughput data (back to 1999) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 in all categories were based on ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. Control Two federal rules address air emissions from Portland cement manufacturing, namely New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS). For specific industrial operations (such as cement manufacturing), EPA addresses criteria pollutants from new, modified and reconstructed sources through NSPS. NESHAP address emissions of hazardous air pollutants from both new and existing sources. The cement manufacturing operations are subject to District regulations regarding permitting (Regulations 2-1 and 2-2), emissions of toxic or hazardous compounds (Regulation 2-5) and some regulations for individual pollutants. For example, Regulation 6-1 reduces particulate emissions from the control imposed by Ringleman requirements. The District adopted Regulation 9, Rule 13, Nitrogen Oxide, Particulate Matter, and Toxic Air Contaminants from Portland Cement Manufacturing, on September 17, 2012. This rule becomes effective on September 9, 2013 and limits the emissions of NOx, PM, and toxic air contaminants. The categories criteria pollutant’s overall control efficiencies (CE) as a result of this rule are listed below: For Category 36, the overall CE of PM increases slightly, to over 99%.; the overall CE of organics is approximately 14%. For Category 1747, the overall CE of NOx is 42%; the overall CE of organics is approximately 45%. For Category 1749, the overall CE of NOx is 42%; the overall CE of organics is approximately 62%. By: Stuart Schultz Date: September 2013 Base Year 2011 4.9 Contaminated Soil Aeration 4.9.1 Emissions Introduction Category 37 accounts for organic emissions from contaminated soil aeration events. Contaminated soil aeration occurs when soil containing organic compounds is excavated and allowed to vent into the open air. These events include underground gasoline tank removal, soil excavation during pipeline leak repairs, and removal of other organic and petroleum chemical spills. Methodology The District requires a written report for any soil aeration activity. These reports were evaluated to determine a generalized emission factor for each event as well as to estimate the total number of excavations. Regulation 8, Rule 40 allows up to 150 pounds per day of organic compound emissions per aeration event. The organic compound emissions factor was calculated assuming the aeration site starts emitting at 120 pounds per day, with emissions halving every ten days, and with emissions set at zero at the 90th day. Two tank removals or replacements are also assumed to occur per aeration event. On average, about 250 excavation events take place annually in the Bay Area. County Distribution The county activity distribution is based on an average number of aeration events in each county in the District. Monthly Variation The monthly factors are assumed to be uniform. More aeration events are assumed to start during weekdays than during weekends. 4.9.2 Trends History State regulations governing the construction standards of gasoline holding tanks required many stations to replace their existing tanks. In our Source Inventory of 1987, the District had 152 excavation events reported. In 1990, this number had grown to 1254. The number of excavations remained above 1100 per year through the mid 1990s. Growth Much of the increase since 1987 had been due to the Porter and Cologne Act regulated by the State Water Resources Control Board and California Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Parts of these underground tank regulations govern the replacement of underground storage tanks. The California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16 stated that by December 22, 1998, all underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances, other than those containing motor vehicle fuels, need to be retrofitted with secondary containment. By the same date, motor vehicle fuel tanks made of steel needed to be retrofitted with secondary containment or be provided with both interior lining and exterior cathodic protection. The number of excavation events remained at close to the 1990 rate through 1998 and declined afterwards. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 40 on February 15, 1989. The overall control afforded by this rule is 81%. This rule applies for soil aeration events only. Air stripping and soil excavation events are inventoried in category 937, under Regulation 8, Rule 47. Rule 40 sets the rate of uncontrolled aeration in addition to describing an acceptable soil aeration procedure. For an uncontrolled aeration, an operator may not aerate the soil at above certain rate per day; however, the soil aeration may be extended over many days. This does not reduce the total emissions from an aeration event. By: Sukarn Claire Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 4.10 Air Stripping and Soil Vapor Extraction 4.10.1 Emissions Introduction This category accounts for the emissions from air stripping and soil vapor extraction processes. Soil and groundwater contamination are the result of leaking underground storage tanks, accidental spills and landfill leachate. Air stripping process is commonly used for contaminated groundwater remediation. Contaminated groundwater is pumped into the air-stripping tower. A blower generally exhausts the effluent air stream from the stripping column. The contaminated air stream is routed to an air pollution control device (i.e., carbon adsorbers). Soil vapor extraction is one of the techniques to extract volatile organic compounds (VOC) from contaminated soil through the use of a vacuum system. Fresh air is injected into the subsurface at locations around the contaminated area. The contaminated air is withdrawn under vacuum from extraction wells. This contaminated air is then vented directly to a VOC treatment system such as carbon adsorbers, thermal incinerators, catalytic incinerators, and condensers prior to being released to the atmosphere. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. Point source emissions are calculated from each equipment’s operating data submitted as part of the permit approval process. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor developed by district staff engineer is used to determine emissions. Monthly Variation The data bank contains percentage of throughput data for each of the four 3-month seasonal periods: (December - February, March - May, June - August, September - November). County Distribution The data bank system contains information on the county location of each processing plant; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. 4.10.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1996) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Future projections of emissions to 2030 are based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 47 on December 20, 1989. This rule requires all facilities to control emissions by at least 90%; however, based on emissions data, the overall control efficiency is estimated at 96%.

Wastewater streams normally are introduced into the POTW collection system through individual or area drains, which can be open to the atmosphere or sealed to prevent wastewater contact with the atmosphere. Emissions are emitted from wastewater collection, treatment, and storage systems through volatilization of organic compounds at the liquid surface. Methodology Category 50 (POTW) contains organic emissions from point sources only. The emissions in this category are from municipal wastewater treatment plants. All plants operating in the District are in the Data Bank System. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these permitted POTW facilities in Category #50 come from combustion sources only. These GHG, namely CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O are calculated in the combustion source categories (i.e. Category Nos. 291, 292, 304, 307, 312, etc.). Other process and fugitive GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from POTW facilities are estimated as an area source in Category 1911. The CH4 emissions from POTW’s (centralized anaerobic) and the N2O emissions from wastewater treatment effluent emissions and biological denitrification were estimated using the California Air Resources Board’s Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (4th Edition, Category: Waste, IPCC: 4D1 – Wastewater Treatment and Discharge). These area source GHG emissions were estimated for the BAAQMD as a whole and not to any specific POTW facility. Monthly Variation The data bank contains percentage of throughput data for each of the four 3-month seasonal periods: (December - February, March - May, June - August, September - November). This throughput data was uniform throughout the week for both categories. County Distribution The county location of each processing plant as reported in the databank is used to distribute emissions into each county for Category 50. The emissions in Category 1911 were distributed according to each District’s county population. 5.1.2 Trends History The historical growth profile for Category 50 was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1990) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Total Population data. The historical growth profile for Category 1911 was based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population data. Growth Projections to year 2030 for both categories were based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 5.2 Landfills, Fugitive Point and Area Sources, Landfill Flares, &amp; Landfill Internal Combustion Engines 5.2.1 Emissions Introduction These four categories account for emissions from landfills in the Bay Area. Categories 1157 and 1158 account for organic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from point and area source landfills, respectively. Category 1157 (Point Source Landfills) also has particulate emissions from activities such as vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping, etc. Categories 1686 and 1687 account for point source criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and GHG emissions (CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from the combustion of landfill gases from flares and internal combustion engines (ICE), respectively, at landfills. Landfill gas may also be combusted in ICE’s outside landfills; however, they are covered in Categories 303 (Reciprocating Engines—Gas Fuels) and 305 (Turbines—Gas Fuels). Landfill gas production rates and compositions vary greatly, even within a single landfill. There are no comprehensive data leading to the development of generalized emission factors for the Bay Area. Biodegradation takes place over an extended period of time, therefore, waste generated in prior years must be considered for emissions calculations. It is assumed it takes 15 years for maximum biodegradation to take place. However, biodegradation occurs, to a lesser extent, 35 years and beyond. (For emission calculation purposes in Categories 1157 and 1158, 40 years for biodegradation was used.) Prior to the mid-1960’s, it was assumed that 60% of the waste was buried in landfills and 40% of the waste was burned on-site. After that it was assumed the burned waste was diverted to the landfills. Methodology Point Sources It is assumed all active landfills within the District are permitted sources. Inactive landfills less than 30 years old and have greater than one million tons of refuse in place are also considered permitted. These permitted landfills are considered to be point sources; their throughput and emission information has been inventoried in the District’s database since the early 1980’s. Although most point source landfills have collection systems associated with them, there are several landfills that do not have a collection system. Landfills with Collection Systems For those landfills with active collection systems, it is assumed that 25% escapes as fugitive landfill gas 75% of the gases are captured and are either destroyed by flaring or burned in an internal combustion engine (ICE) or turbine. Those captured gases that are flared or burned in an ICE or turbine are accounted for and reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) under our combustion “C” sources. The following are a list of source codes associated with the criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from landfills with collection systems: G7145511. The throughput associated with this source code represents the amount of landfill gas collected for a particular year. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive methane and GHG emissions from this source based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas collection system captures 75% of the total amount of landfill gas generated at the site (AP-42, Chapter 2.4); the remaining 25% of landfill gas is assumed to be fugitive emissions. Landfill gas, on average, contains 55% methane (CH4), 40% carbon dioxide (CO2), with the remaining 5% nitrogen, oxygen, non-methane organic compounds, etc. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (Category: Managed waste Disposal Sites, Sector: Industrial: Landfills, not specified). Constants used in the emission factor calculations are as follows: The standard molar volume of gases is 387.006 scf/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CH4 is 16.043 lbs/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.010 lbs/lb-mole. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Combustion Sources Using Landfill Gas. The assumed 75% landfill gases captured are combusted in the “C” sources by flaring or used as fuel in turbines or IC engines. A 99% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed for flaring operations; a 97% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed when landfill gas is burned in an internal combustion engine. A slightly higher TOG destruction efficiency, 99% or more, is achieved in turbines. Particulate, NOx, SOx, and CO emissions are also considered as products of combustion. Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions are also calculated from these combustion sources. The CH4 and CO2 emission factors were based from both EPA AP-42 and District sources. The N2O emission factor was based on California Energy Commission data. The CO2 emissions emitted from these combustion sources are considered to be biogenic. G7145580. This source code represents the fugitive ROG emissions with throughput given as the amount of refuse as tons-in-place. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145540. This source code represents fugitive ROG emissions from the on-site handling of contaminated soils. This soil is usually contaminated from gasoline or diesel, and the units associated with this material code are in tons/yr. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145466. This source code represents particulate PM10 emissions from landfill activity that includes vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping and dumping activities, wind erosion from land cover, etc. Throughput is based on tons of incoming waste for a particular year. Landfills without Collection Systems For those few landfills without collection systems, the following is the source code associated with this type of landfill: G7159580. The throughput from this source code represents the total tons in place of refuse. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive organic and GHG emissions from this type of landfill based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas generation rate (LGR) of methane is dependent upon the age of landfill, moisture content, type of refuse, etc. and will vary from landfill to landfill. The landfill gas composition for these types of landfills is approximately 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Area Sources Area sources consist of inactive landfills that had less than 1 million ton of refuse in place. These landfills were closed many years ago and data is very limited. In 1999, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 10% of the total waste in place. In future years, this value will decrease linearly because of less contribution from these area sources. In 2008, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 7.75% of the total waste in place. The assumptions used estimate criteria pollutant (organics) and GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions listed below: The LGR of methane for these closed landfills was 0.030 mcf/year – ton-in-place. The landfill gas composition for area source landfills is similar to point source landfills without collection systems, namely 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. The ROG factor for area source landfills is the same as for point source landfills at 0.0089. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Monthly Variation Estimated daily emissions are assumed to be uniform for all months of the year. This is due to burial/insulation of the refuse that reduces impact of ambient temperature changes, allowing somewhat uniform biodegradation throughout the year. County Distribution Point Source Categories (Cat. Nos. 1157, 1686, and 1687) The data bank system contains information on the county location of each landfill; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. It is assumed San Francisco County has had no landfills within their boundaries; therefore, their refuse is transported to the other counties. Area Source Category (Cat. No. 1158) The county fractions were based in the number of closed landfills (not accounted for by the District) in the in each county. This data was obtained from the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) at CalRecycle’s website (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov). 5.2.2 Trends History &amp; Growth Category Nos. 1157 and 1158’s historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Population growth profile, Percentage of cumulative waste generation attributed to point or area source, Per capita waste generation, and Overall collection efficiency of the landfill gas. As mentioned previously, prior to the mid-1960’s, it was assumed 60% of the waste was buried in landfills (point source) and 40% of the waste was burned on-site, as in backyard incinerators. By 1999, it was assumed that 90% of the cumulative waste generation was attributed to point sources, and the remaining 10% was attributed to area sources. By 2030, it is assumed the point source percentage will increase linearly to 97.75% and the area source percentage will decrease linearly to 2.25% Since the State of California passed a mandate (Assembly Bill 939) that required a reduction in waste generation, per capita waste generation in the District has decreased. Until 1990, this factor was approximately 1.32 tons/person/year; in 2008, it had decreased to 0.79 tons/person/yr. By 2030, it is assumed the per capita waste generation in the District will decrease linearly to 0.70 tons/person/year. In addition to what was previously mentioned, Categories Nos. 1686 and 1687 historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Prior to 1984 (the year Reg. 8, Rule 34 was passed), it was assumed all landfill gases were emitted as fugitive emissions. By 1996, the overall collection efficiency at landfills was assumed to be 75%, with 25% of the landfill gases emitted as fugitive emissions. Between those two years, the collection efficiencies were interpolated. Control Currently, Regulation 8, Rule 34 (Solid Waste Disposal Sites) requires that certain landfills process landfill gases through a gas collection and emission control system such that: There are no leaks that exceed 1000 PPM by volume measured as methane at any component or connector of the landfill gas collection system; and The collected gases are process in an enclosed ground type flare with a TOG destruction efficiency of at least 98% by weight; or The collected gases are processed in an energy recovery device or emission control system that reduces the amount of TOG by at 97% by weight.

Greenhouse gas emissions, namely methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were also calculated for this category. Methodology Emissions for this category are calculated by multiplying the annual activity (throughput) value for a particular year by the emission factor in question. The annual activity (throughput) for this category was obtained from the March 2009 report “Bay Area Biosolids Management: Challenges, Opportunities, and Policies.” The amount of biosolids generated in in the Bay Area in 2007 was estimated to be 158,000 dry tons. Approximately 19% of that amount, or 30,020 dry tons, was “land applied” for Land Farming purposes. The Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Total Population growth profile was used to obtain the 2011 throughput value of 31,028 dry tons/year. The emission factor for reactive organic gases (ROG) was obtained from the California Integrated Waste Management Board Contractor’s Report to the Board, “Emissions Testing of Volatile Organic Compounds from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the Sab Joaquin Valley”, October 2007. The ROG emission factor for greenwaste /food scrap composting ranged from 1.3 – 2.6 lbs./ton composted. A mid- point value of 1.95 lbs./ton was used. A ROG factor of 0.8689 was used to calculate the total organic gas (TOG) emission factor. This ROG factor was obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for greenwaste composting. The TOG emissions factor of 2.24 lbs./ton was calculated by dividing the ROG emission factor by the ROG factor. The CH4 emission factor of 0.29 lbs./ton was calculated by subtracting the TOG emission factor by the ROG emission factor. The N2O emission factor of 1.1997 lbs./ton was obtained from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste. Monthly Variation For monthly variation, the emissions are distributed evenly throughout the year. County Distribution Data attributing the throughput activity to the various Bay Area counties was obtained from the March 2009 report “Bay Area Biosolids Management: Challenges, Opportunities, and Policies.” 5.3.2 Trends History Until the early 1990’s, land farming consisted of wastes more from the industrial sector. Most of these industrial wastes are now transported outside the District to be spread on the land. Prior to 1990, the growth was based on the ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Between 1990 and 1993 growth was interpolated. Growth Emissions after 1993 are assumed to grow at a rate similar to the population as provided by ABAG’s 2009 Population growth profile. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 5.4 Other Waste Management 5.4.1 Emissions Introduction This category accounts for emissions from other industrial and commercial - waste management facilities. Emissions from this category were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s Data Bank. Greenhouse gas emissions, namely carbon dioxide (CO2) was also calculated for this category. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. Monthly Variation The data band contains percentage of throughput data for each of the four 3-month seasonal periods: (December - February, March - May, June - August, September - November). County Distribution The data bank system contains information on the county location of each processing plant; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. 5.4.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 2005) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were also based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile.

Composting most often takes place in aerobic conditions, however, under certain conditions, composting can occur under anaerobic conditions. These conditions include compost pile structure and density, particle size, low oxygen supply, moisture content, low oxygen supply, etc. Methane emissions increase under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, proper monitoring and management are very important to maintain aerobic conditions for efficient composting operation. The composting process includes the following steps: Feedstock Preparation, Composting, Curing, Screening, and Storage. In the feedstock preparation step, the composted organic materials are screened and, if required, processed in a grinder to achieve the best composting conditions. This mixture is then placed in rows or piles where the decomposition process begins. The initial phase of composting, lasting for about one month is very active and generates temperatures high enough to kill weed seeds and pathogens. After this “active” phase, the material is cured at a slower rate and temperature. During this phase, the moisture content is reduced and a more stable product is produced. Once the compost is cured, the material is screened to produce the desired product and then stored prior to final distribution and use. Methodology In 2011, there were approximately 32 composting facilities1 in the Bay Area. Ten (12) of these facilities are permitted by the District and considered point sources (Category 1709). The point sources contain annual activity (throughput) information for each applicable source that is stored in the District’s Data Bank. Reactive organic (ROG) emissions are then calculated by using emission factors (generalized or specific) and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. Some related compositing activity (i.e. windrow and storage activities, etc.) are also permitted and particulate emissions are calculated. Note: The composting operations that involve mushroom farming were not included in this count. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse Gas Inventories does not assign mushroom farm media preparation to the waste sector for emission inventory development. It falls under the Industrial Processes and Product Use, Food and Beverage Industry, or Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use, manure Management, Poultry (3A2i). The other approximate 20 facilities are considered area sources (Category 1936) where annual throughput, criteria pollutant emission factors (TOG and ROG), and control activity (if any) are estimated. The TOG and ROG emissions are calculated by multiplying the throughput by the emission factor and, if applicable, the control factor. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), are also associated with composting activity. The CH4 and N2O emissions are calculated similarly to the criteria pollutant emissions mentioned above. The throughput and emissions factors (TOG, ROG, and GHG) estimates were developed based on the following: Throughput Data For those composting facilities not permitted by the District (area sources), throughput data was provided by industry and CalRecycle officials or using CalRecycle’s Solid Waste Information System’s (SWIS’s) database. The throughput information provided in the SWIS database represents maximum allowable throughputs. The actual throughput was estimated to be 60% of the SWIS database value. The units for throughput information should be in tons per year, however, they may appear in other units, such as cubic yards per year (yd3/yr), cubic yards per day (yd3/day), tons per day, etc. For those throughputs that required a conversion factor to tons, the following bulk density values were used: Greenwaste – 3.54 yd3/ton Mixed (greenwaste mixed with food, manure, etc.) – 2.24 yd3/ton The above conversion factors were taken from the California Integrated Management Board (CIWMB) Report, “Third Assessment of California’s Compost and Mulch Producing Infrastructure”, May 2009. For throughputs that were in a volume per day format, it was assumed most facilities operated 260 days per year. However, for some facilities, this value may vary slightly. Emission Factors The Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.85 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 1.95 lbs/ton The emission factors above were cited in the October 2007 CIWMB study, “Emission Testing of VOC from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the San Joaquin Valley.” The mid-point value for each of the emission factors was used. Total Organic Gas (TOG) emission factors were calculated by dividing the ROG emission factors by a ROG factor. A ROG factor, obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD), of 0.8689 was used. The TOG emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.98 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 2.24 lbs/ton Methane (CH4) emission factors were assumed to be the difference between the TOG and ROG emission factors. The CH4 emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.13 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 0.29 lbs/ton The Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emission factors varied from 0.12 to 1.1997 lbs/ton and were obtained from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste. The N2O emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.12 lb/ton Greenwaste, including food – 0.6599 lb/ton Mixed (greenwaste, manure, etc.) – 1.1997 lbs/ton Emission Calculation The TOG, ROG, CH4, and N2O annual emissions for an area source (Category 1936) facility were calculated by multiplying the estimated throughput by the respective pollutant emission factor. Monthly Variation The emissions are assumed to be distributed evenly throughout the year. County Distribution The county distribution was based on the location as found in the District databank or SWIS data mentioned above. 5.5.2 Trends History It was assumed composting in the Bay Area began in the mid-1980’s (1985 was used as the starting point). There was limited information in prior years, so it was assumed throughput activity exhibited a linear decrease from 2005 back to 1985. From 2005 – 2008, the growth was based on the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Total Population growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on the ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Control Currently, there is no District rule regulating emissions from compost facilities. However, there are several facilities in the Bay Area with in-vessel composting where it is assumed there is an overall VOC control efficiency of 90%.
