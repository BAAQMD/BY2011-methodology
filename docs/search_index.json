["general-refinery-emissions.html", "2.1 General Refinery Emissions", " 2.1 General Refinery Emissions 2.1.1 Emissions Introduction Petroleum refining involves processing crude oil into consumable products such as fuel gas, lube oil, and grease. To achieve this process, an array of equipment is used to refine crude oil; the emissions that are generated as a byproduct from these processes make up the petroleum refining emissions categories. Emissions reported are those generated via basic refining processes/devices and do not include emissions from refinery fugitives, storage units, and combustion processes (other than flares and blow down systems). These non-included sources are accounted for in other categories of the emission inventory report. Category 10 accounts for emissions from refining processes that involve chemical reactions, such as, but not limited to cracking, polymerization, and reforming. Significant amounts of nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulfur oxide (SOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate (PM) emissions are produced during catalytic cracking and coking operations. Category 11 includes all permitted refinery oil/water separation equipment and fugitive emissions from process drains. This category also contains units such as clarifiers and dissolved air flotation systems. Category 12 accounts for emissions from treatment of wastewater at oil refineries. Category 13 contains emissions from cooling systems. Emissions from cooling towers consist of fugitive VOC’s and dissolved gases (such as hydrogen sulfide and ammonia) which are leaked through heat exchangers into cooling water. The contaminants are then vaporized into the atmosphere at the cooling tower. Category 14 includes emissions from vacuum producing systems. Vacuum systems are used primarily to distill heavy crude residues which cannot be distilled at atmospheric pressure. Category 15 accounts for all refinery process gas (combustion) emissions from flares and blow down systems. Refinery flares can emit large quantities of organics, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide as well as greenhouse gases. Category 16 includes emissions from all other refinery processes not covered in category 15. Emissions of organic compounds and greenhouse gases from storage tanks, sulfur recovery units, and combustion processes are included in chapters/sections on Petroleum Products, Chemical Plants, and Turbines, respectively. The processes in this category include distillation, hydrogen manufacturing plants, fuel blending. Coke loading and storage facilities account for most of the particulate emissions in this category. Methodologies Emissions for these categories are obtained from point source data in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank). Emissions are updated annually, on a source-by-source basis, using the following inputs: Process material throughputs as reported by the refineries (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by refineries or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by refineries also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county fraction and monthly/daily factors are calculated based on data obtained from the Data Bank. 2.1.2 Trends History Historic emissions have generally varied with refinery throughputs. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credit (IERC). IERC banking emissions are now inventoried separately under categories 298-301. Also, flare source emissions from categories 298 and 299 are now accounted for in category 15. Beginning in December 2003, flare emission monitoring control was implemented for all refineries in the Bay Area. Flare emissions are based upon these monitoring data. In 2010, SOx decreased significantly as a result of an abatement device installation at Valero refinery. Over 90% of SOx emissions were reduced at Valero refinery from prior years. Growth Projected growth for all refinery related categories was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2011) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to remain relatively flat. This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Future flare emissions are difficult to predict, since they are predicated on emergencies and the nature of emergencies which are unknown and unpredictable. However, with the recent passage of refinery flare monitoring and flare minimization plan requirements, flare emissions are expected to remain constant as long as there are no large upset in refinery processes that would warrant increase in flaring activities. Control Refinery emissions are regulated by the District. Regulations 6, 7, 8, and 9 regulate Particulate Matter, Odorous Substances, Organic Compounds, and Inorganic Gaseous Pollutants respectably. Regulation 12, Rules 11 and 12 pertain to flare monitoring and flare minimization plan at Petroleum Refineries. The rule does not mandate reductions. District staff has found that because refiners have looked more closely both at monitoring and the feasibility of flaring reductions, flaring activities at the five Bay Area refineries have dropped dramatically over the past years. The result has been a significant emission reduction that cannot be directly attributed to this rule, but has and will ultimately be reflected in the emissions.

["refinery-fugitive-emissions.html", "2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions", " 2.2 Refinery Fugitive Emissions 2.2.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 17, 18, and 19 contain refinery fugitive emissions from sealed equipment. These emissions are treated as point sources and are unique to each refinery. Emissions occur from process equipment whenever components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict occurrences. Valve and flange leaks account for the bulk of total fugitive emissions while pressure relief valves account for the smallest amount of total fugitive emissions. Methodologies The petroleum refineries are periodically surveyed for the number of mechanical components utilized in an oil refining process. These components include valves, PRVs, pumps, and compressor seals. Individual types of components are summed up and emissions are calculated based on throughputs and specific emission factors. Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutant, mainly total organic compounds, and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from information collected in the District’s data bank. Information such as plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation are also stored in the data bank. 2.2.2 Trends History Historical changes in fugitive emissions in the Bay Area have been due to installation of newer process units that supplement rather than replace old process units. Growth It is expected that fugitive emissions will not increase significantly in future after new units are built to produce reformulated gasoline. Control The District adopted control regulations in 1980 for valves and flanges, pump and compressor seals and PRVs. This marked the first step in the control of fugitive emissions. Control for valves vary widely, gas PRVs are 95% controlled, while heavy liquid valves have negligible control. Most common and significant emission sources are the light liquid service valves, and they are controlled by 65 to 72%. In 1997 and 1998, the District combined the three previous regulations 8-18, 8-25, and 8- 28, into a single regulation, Equipment Leaks, # 8-18. Regulation 8-25 was deleted. Regulation 8-28 was changed to focus on episodic emissions from the normal operation of pressure relief valves. During this change the leak standard for only the pressure relief valves was reduced from 10,000 parts per million (ppm) to 500 ppm of total organic compounds. In addition, applicability of the new Regulation 8-18 was broadened to include all leaking equipment, not just valves, flanges, and other equipment specifically listed in the earlier regulation. The following table summarizes the limits. FIXME: TABLE OMITTED By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["refinery-process-vessel-depressurization.html", "2.3 Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization", " 2.3 Refinery Process Vessel Depressurization 2.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions for this category are generated from depressurization of process vessels at petroleum refineries. Generally a standard procedure requires repeated purging of the process vessel with inert gasses to reduce the concentration of organic vapors to below 300 PPM, before venting a vessel to the atmosphere. Methodology These emissions are from point sources data reported annually. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the refineries. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Greenhouse gas emission factors are also provided by the individual refineries and/or taken from EPA. Emissions for greenhouse gases including CO2, CH4, and N2O are reported by the refinery during the District’s annual permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 2.3.2 Trends History Emissions for category 20 have been relatively insignificant for last few years, at less than 5 pounds per day for the entire region. Growth Projected growth for this category is based on the throughput of marine operations. Control The District adopted Regulation 8-10 on July 20, 1983.

Coatings processes includes mixes, blends, or compounding of paints, varnishes, lacquers, enamels, shellac, or sealers from raw materials. Ink manufacturing involves mixes, blends or compounding other raw materials to produce the ink. Printing inks consist of pigments, which produce the desired colors, binders which lock the pigment to the substrate, and solvents, usually organic compounds that dissolve the pigments and binders. A majority of the emissions originate from mixing and cleaning operations. Throughput information of each source is reported by the facilities and is stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated by using data on the reported throughput, the specific materials ( i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as supplied by the companies through the District “S” and “G” forms. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA).

The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on major coatings and inks manufacturer’s reported quarterly percent throughput. An attempt was made to weight-average into monthly factor, with March through August being the high season and November and December being the lowest. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.1.2 Trends History Emissions have been generally increasing due to increasing demand on coatings and inks, which has been about 4 to 8 percent per year in the 1980’s. District Regulation 8, Rule 35, pertaining to emissions control from mixing operations at coating and ink facilities was adopted in May 1984. Since the adoption of the regulation, there have been significant changes in the manufacturing process. It was estimated there was a 55% emission reduction due to the implementation of the regulation. Growth Projections to year 2030 was based on growth profile of ARB’s Manufacturing in the Printing Industry, and is expected to grow at a only 1-2 percent per year. Control Regulation 8, Rule 35 was amended effective January 1993, eliminating the exemptions from small users, requiring lids on all portable and stationary mixing vats, and other cleaning provisions. Control effectiveness of the amended regulation has resulted in an 84% emission reduction since 1993. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["resins.html", "3.2 Resins", " 3.2 Resins 3.2.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from operations performed at resin manufacturing facilities. Resin is a semi-solid, water insoluble organic material with little or no tendency to crystallize under standard temperature and atmospheric conditions. Resins are the basic components of plastics and other surface coating formulations. Equipment used in the operations and manufacturing of resins include resin reactor vessels and thinning/blending tanks. The manufacturing of resins produces mostly organic emissions. Methodology Organic emissions are calculated based on throughput data, material description (i.e. density, percent VOC in coatings, etc.) as reported by the companies via the Bay Area Air District’s “S” and “G” air permit forms. The District obtain each year, as necessary, updates for the data during the permit renewal process. The data is gathered on a source- by-source basis using the following criteria as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). In addition to criteria pollutants, greenhouse gases are also produced in the manufacturing of resins. The greenhouse gas emission factors are provided by the plants and in some instances where they are not supplied, they are taken from EPA literature/publications. The monthly distribution is estimated based on data from the company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput. The county location of each company as reported in the District’s record keeping system (Data Bank) is used to distribute emissions into each county. 3.2.2 Trends History Emissions have increased due to increasing demand from related industries, such as plastics and coating manufacturers. District Regulation 8, Rule 36, limiting emissions from resin manufacturing operations was adopted in June 1984. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on growth profile of ARB’s Chemical Manufacturing which is expected to grow at about 2-3 percent per year for the next few years.

["pharmaceuticals-cosmetics.html", "3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics", " 3.3 Pharmaceuticals &amp; Cosmetics 3.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the pharmaceuticals and cosmetics industry. The emissions consisted of both point (Category 25) and area (Category 1897) source emissions. Pharmaceuticals manufacturing plants are those producing and/or blending chemicals for use in the formulation and production of pharmaceutical products. These consist of the manufacture, packaging, and sales of chemicals used as medication for humans and animals. Sources of emissions at pharmaceutical plants may come from batch process equipment, such as reactors, distillation units, extractors, centrifuges, filters, crystallizers, dryers, and storage and transfer. Several different products are manufactured at Cosmetics products facilities. Organic chemicals are used as raw materials and solvents; such as ethanol, acetone, isopropanol, etc. are used. Solvent is recovered where convenient, and as a means of cost effectiveness. Emissions from these operations are almost entirely non-methane organic solvents. There is a wide variety of products manufactured from these two industries, which may also include non-pharmaceuticals for preventive medicine and health-enhancement, medicated and non-medicated cosmetics, and food additives. Methodology The amount of solvent usage by the pharmaceutical manufacturers was estimated based on the U.S. Dept. of Commerce “Current Industrial Reports”, and the “Census of Manufacturers”. It was assumed solvent usage from the cosmetics industry was included from this estimate. Using one dollar per gallon of alcohol, the dollar estimate was converted to gallons. This amount was projected for Bay Area use with an annual growth rate of 2.6 % from 1993. It was assumed this is the total solvent usage by the pharmaceutical and cosmetics industries. The average solvent density was assumed to be 6.6 lbs./gal. The District data bank reported point sources from several pharmaceutical companies. Throughput and other data information of each source are reported by the facilities. Emissions are calculated by using these data through the District “S” and “G” forms. It is assumed there are also a number of other smaller pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturers, known as area sources, not included in the District data bank system. Subtracting the total solvent usage estimate from the point source usage yields an area source solvent usage. An uncontrolled emission factor of 330 lbs./1000 gallons is based on a 5% loss of the usage. District Regulation 8, Rule 24, limiting organic compounds emissions from various pharmaceutical and cosmetics manufacturing operation took effect in July 1984 with an estimated 42% overall control. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was assumed to be uniform. County Distribution The ratio of each County’s population was used to distribute emission into counties. 3.3.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated by using the estimated solvent usage by the industry. Growth Emissions through the year 2030 are projected according to estimated growth prediction of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products industry. Approximately 0.8% per year of growth is expected in the next few years. Control Efforts are being made to streamline and standardize rules and regulations. Any subsequent refinement in Regulation 8, Rule 24 due to this streamlining should not have any effect on the controls, and therefore the controls for this rule will remain at 42%.

Category 22 contains emissions from sulfuric acid storage tanks at refineries and chemical plants. The emissions of concern from these categories are sulfur dioxide. Abatement devices to treat sulfur recovery units’ tail gas and sulfur dioxide scrubbers at sulfuric acid manufacturing plants have significantly reduced the amount of sulfur dioxide emitted. The emissions data shows that without the District’s controls, 150 tons per day of sulfur dioxide would have been emitted in to the atmosphere instead of approximately 3 tons per day. Category 26 contains all other chemical plant point source emissions. Some of these sources include acid manufacturing plants, kiln burners, and specialty chemicals manufacturing plants. Emissions caused by the combustion of fuels at chemical plants are not accounted for in this category. Category 27 contains fugitive emissions at chemical plants. Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are potential sources that can leak due to seal failure. These emissions generally occur randomly and are difficult to predict. In addition, these emissions may be intermittent and vary in intensity over time. According to EPA report (EPA-625/10-84-004, Dec. 1984) 35% of the total emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities are emitted as fugitive emissions. Methodologies These categories contain both point and area source emissions from chemical plants in the District. Most of the emissions (point sources) from chemical plants are accounted for through our permitting processes, however, Category 27 fugitive emissions (area sources) are not. Fugitive emissions for Category 27 were taken as 35% of the total organic emissions at the chemical manufacturing facilities (Categories 21 through 26) within the District. The number of equipment components was used as throughput. Emissions for Categories 21, 22, and 26 were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source- by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported annually by the chemical manufacturing companies. Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the companies also). Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced in the chemical plant processes. Since these emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. Monthly Variation and County Distribution The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. 3.4.2 Trends History In general, emissions increase as throughputs increase. In addition to usage changes, new installations also increase the emissions. Overall emissions for these categories did not significantly increase in last eight years. Growth The projected growths in these categories are taken from expected growth in manufacturing employment over the region to the year 2030. The employment data was obtained from the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 “Projections” reports. Control The District adopted Regulation 8-22 on March 5, 1980. The control afforded by this rule is estimated to be 60%, with rule effectiveness at 98% for an overall control rate of 59%. This rule only affects fugitive emissions at chemical manufacturing facilities. Regulation 9 also controls non-organic emissions from many of the manufacturing plants in these categories. For example, the District amended Regulation 9-1 in 1983, 1992, and 1995 for sulfur dioxide limits at sulfur recovery systems and sulfuric acid plants. Regulation 9 also sets limits on hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen oxides, and carbon monoxide emissions. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

["large-and-small-bakeries.html", "4.1 Large and Small Bakeries", " 4.1 Large and Small Bakeries Emissions from these categories are from large commercial bakeries as well as smaller bakeries. Bread is produced either by sponge-dough process, brews (or liquid sponges) process, or straight-dough process. Commercial bakeries more often use the sponge-dough process, where ingredients are initially mixed, bread dough fermented from 3 to 5 hours, and then baked in ovens at about 450 °F. Bakery products such as sweet rolls, crackers, pretzels, cakes, cookies, doughnuts, biscuits, etc. are either leavened by yeast or by baking powder. Yeast metabolizes the sugars and starches in the dough during fermentation process. The end product of this chemical reaction is primarily carbon dioxide and ethanol (TOG). The major criteria pollutant emitted from bread baking is primarily ethanol, which is a by-product of the leavening process. Emissions of combustion products from the burning of fuel in the ovens stacks are not considered in this category. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is calculated from the combustion of the ethanol from the bread in an abatement device such as an afterburner. The abatement devices are used on the larger (point source) ovens. There is no CO2 emission data from the fermentation process available at this time. 4.1.1 Methodologies Throughput information from large bakeries are reported and stored in the District’s Data Bank system. Source tests, which are conducted at various times, provide the data for criteria pollutant emission factors. (During the rulemaking process in the late 1980’s, fifteen ovens from six large bakeries in the Bay Area were source tested by the District. Ethanol (TOG) emissions ranged from 0.3 to 7.0 pounds per thousand pounds bread produced, depending on the oven size, operating temperature, and type of product.) As mentioned above, CO2 emissions are estimated from the combustion of ethanol from the bread in an abatement device. Emissions from these larger bakeries are called point sources (Category #28). There are numerous smaller bakeries in the Bay Area, which are not in the Data Bank system. These bakeries use smaller ovens. Source test results showed an emission factor of 5.4 pounds ethanol per ton of bread produced. Emissions from these smaller bakeries are called area sources (Category #935). Throughput data for small bakeries was based on a survey regarding the large bakeries. Small bakeries showed an approximately 37% share of the total bread market. The 2011 average daily throughput from smaller bakeries was calculated to be about 79,676 tons/year. TOG emissions from small bakeries were 1,179 pounds/day (0.59 ton per day) Monthly Variation For large bakeries, monthly distribution was based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. For small bakeries (area sources), monthly distribution was based on a 1990 production of a large bakery, which is assumed to be typical. County Distribution The county locations and associated emissions of each of the large bakeries were used to distribute countywide emissions. For small bakeries, the number of employees in the large bakeries was subtracted from the total number of employees in each county’s bakeries. This data was found in the U.S Census Department’s 2010 County Business Patterns 4.1.2 Trends 4.1.2.1 History Historical emissions were estimated using actual throughputs and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile. District Regulation 8, Rule 42 set standards for new and modified bakery ovens on large commercial bakeries effective January of 1989. Growth Emissions projections to 2030 were also based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing and Wholesale Employment growth profile. Control District Regulation 8-42 was amended requiring control equipment for existing ovens, which commenced operation prior to January 1989. This became effective beginning January 1992.

Carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas, is also emitted from cooking process in these three categories. Restaurant equipment that contributes to these emissions includes charbroilers (Category 29), deep fat fryers (Category 1710) and griddles (Category 1711). Charbroilers can either be conveyorized or under-fire; both types generally use natural gas, however, under-fire charbroilers may use solid fuels, such as charcoal or wood. Deep-fat fryers may be either gas-fired or electric to heat the cooking oil used to cook the food. Griddles use an exposed metal plate, heated by either gas or electricity, to cook the food. These categories do not include the products of combustion emissions from fuel usage (i.e. natural gas or solid fuels) at these establishments. Those emissions can be found in Categories 307, 1590, or 312. Methodology The District estimated the number of restaurants in operation in the Bay Area with assistance from each county’s health department. Each county health department provided the number of restaurants permitted within their jurisdiction. The District refined the number of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that are less likely to cook, such as delicatessens and ice cream parlors. The District used a 1997 South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) report, “Staff Recommendations Regarding Controlling Emissions from Restaurant Operations”, to estimate the number of charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles used in the Bay Area. The SCAQMD report surveyed the type of equipment that was used in restaurant cooking operations in their district boundaries. This report found approximately 33% of the restaurants operates under-fired charbroilers, 4% operate chain-driven charbroilers, 62% operate deep fat fryers, and 52% operate griddles. The average amount of food cooked on each type of appliance was developed for the California Air Resources Board by the Public Research Institute. Emission factors, developed by the University of California at Riverside and the University of Minnesota, were used to quantify the emissions each type of food cooked on charbroilers, deep fat fryers, and griddles. Total District throughputs for each type of food for each device were calculated by multiplying the amount of food cooked by the number of restaurants with that particular cooking device. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the emission factor by the throughput. The total organic gas (TOG) emitted from these three categories is considered all reactive (i.e. TOG equals ROG). The PM emissions emitted from these three categories are particulate matter less than 10 microns in size (PM10) since it is assumed all particles larger than 10 microns are captured before the outside exhaust. A portion of these PM10 emissions are in the form of condensable vapors. Condensable are vapors in the gaseous form at entry into the ventilation hood, but may condense into particulate form (i.e. liquid or solid state) in the duct works, as it exits the exhaust fan, or in the atmosphere. At the time of this writing, condensable PM is not included in the particulate calculations for these categories. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on seasonal variation of each establishment, which is a higher sale during summer months due to longer daylight hours and warmer weather. County Distribution The number of eating establishments in each county was based on data provided by each of the Bay Area’s county health department. The District refined these numbers of restaurants by eliminating the ones not open to the public, gone out of business, or those that were less likely to cook. 4.2.2 Trends History Emissions back to 1996 were estimated based on historical number of eating establishments in the Bay Area as reported in the “Taxable Sales in California (Sales &amp; Use Tax) publications. Prior to 1996 the emissions were based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Control On December 5, 2007, the District adopted Regulation 6, Rule 2, Commercial Cooking Equipment, to reduce particulate and VOC emissions from commercial cooking equipment. Effective January 1, 2009, chain-driven charbroilers that cook at least 400 pounds of beef per week are required to operate with a certified catalytic oxidizer to control emissions of both PM and VOC. Effective January 1, 2010, any newly installed under-fired charbroiler that has a grill surface area of at least 10 square feet and cooks at least 800 pounds of beef per week will be required to install a control device to reduce PM10 emissions to no more than 1 pound of PM10 per 1000 pounds of beef cooked. . Effective January 1, 2013, any existing restaurant having an under-fired charbroiler that has a grill surface area of at least 10 square feet and cooks at least 800 pounds of beef per week will be required to install a control device to reduce PM10 emissions by the same amount. These charbroilers (chain-driven and under-fired) must also be registered through the District By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["wineriesbreweries-fermentation.html", "4.3 Wineries/Breweries - Fermentation", " 4.3 Wineries/Breweries - Fermentation 4.3.1 Emissions Introduction This category accounts for the ethanol emissions resulting from the fermentation of grapes at wineries located in the Bay Area. During the fermentation process, sugar in the grape juice reacts with yeast to form ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide (CO2) gas. Ethanol is emitted into the atmosphere through evaporation. The amount of ethanol formation is dependent on tank design, length of fermentation period, fermentation temperature, and volume and sugar content of fermenting juice. Sugar content is measured as degrees Brix (grams sugar/100 ml. juice). Methodology Wine production in the Bay Area was estimated based on ARB’s methodology and Wine Institute‘s Grape Crush report. Ethanol emission factors from the two types of wine (White and Red) were derived by the ARB from a computer model developed by Williams and Boulton. The ethanol emission factors per thousand gallons of wine produced for white wine, rose wine, and red wine are listed below: White wine: 2.5 lbs. Rose and Red wine: 6.2 lbs. Using an estimated production of wine as: 41.5% white and 58.5% red wine, a composite emission factor of 4.7 lbs. per thousand gallon of wine produced was derived. The carbon dioxide (CO2) emission factor was derived from the chemical equation. \\[ C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + \\text{yeast} \\rightarrow 2\\ C_{2}H_{5}OH + 2\\ CO_{2} \\] Assume that fifty percent of CO2 emissions escaped to atmosphere during fermentation process, the CO2 emission factor of 157.41 lbs. per thousands of gallons of wine was estimated. District’s Regulations 3, adopted on May 21, 2008, defined the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wine fermentation processes was biogenic carbon dioxide emissions. The total emissions for this category are determined by multiplying the emission factor and the wine production. This methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5.1). Emissions from point sources are calculated from operating data (throughput, emission factors, control factors, if any, etc.) submitted for each equipment as part of the permit process. This operating data is updated upon renewal of the permit. Monthly Variation The ethanol emissions associated with wine fermentation occurs during the grape crushing season, which generally runs from mid-August through October. County Distribution County distribution was based on the amount of wine production in each county. Alameda, Contra Costa, Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma Counties were assumed to produce wine. 4.3.2 Trends History Prior to Base Year 2005, the throughput had been obtained from the “Final Grape Crush Report” published by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Although phylloxera bugs attack vine rootstock, the wine production in vineyards increased at moderate rate in 1996. ARB revised Winery methodology in September 2004 to reflect current wine production in California. The historical throughput data between 2004 and 2010 were obtained from the Wine Institute located in San Francisco Growth Past and future projection of emissions was based on the food manufacturing industries taken from ABAG’s 2009 Projections report.

["wineriesbreweries-aging.html", "4.4 Wineries/Breweries - Aging", " 4.4 Wineries/Breweries - Aging 4.4.1 Emissions Introduction This category consists of both area and point sources. The area source accounts for the ethanol emissions from aging of brandy. Brandy is produced from a distillation process, separating ethanol and other volatile substances from fermented juices. The brandy is then aged for a period of two to ten years. During the aging process, usually, in 50-gallon oak barrels, there is a considerable amount of ethanol emissions released from the barrels into the atmosphere. The point source portion accounts for organic emissions from brewery sources contained in the District’s Data Bank. Methodology San Joaquin Valley District estimated 4,561,546 gallons of brandy in 2007. The 57,380 barrels of Brandy in Bay Area were estimated based upon the above reported data. An emission factor for a 50-gallon Brandy barrel was derived by the Wine Institute. The assumption being: brandy is 120 proof (60% alcohol) on the average; and alcohol is lost during aging at a rate of 2.5% per year per barrel. This resulted in an emission factor of 4.96 lbs. ethanol per barrel of Brandy. Emissions calculations from the aging of brandy consist of multiplying the emission factor with the amount of brandy barrels in storage in the District. The methodology is presently based on ARB’s methodology (Section 5-2). Monthly Variation Brandy is aged for a period of years, during which emissions are released 365 days per year and 24 hours per day. County Distribution County distribution is based on the number of 50-gallon brandy barrels in each county. Napa, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma counties are assumed to produce or to store the 50-gallon brandy barrels. 4.4.2 Trends History From 1980 to 1987, estimated emissions were based on the summary report of the number of alcoholic production facilities in California published by U.S. Department of Census. The number of alcoholic production facilities had been reduced in Santa Clara County due to increasing new electronic manufacturers and housing development. However, grape production has increased since 1988; therefore, emissions were estimated to be at constant level during 1988-1990. In 1993, grape crush was down approximately 7 % from the 1992 crush, and 7 % less than the record-large 1982 crush of 3,115,531 tons. Emissions from 1993 to 1998 are assumed to be constant at the 1993 production level.

Methodology This category consists only of point sources that are contained in the District Data Bank system. Individual companies report information on plant equipment, operating data, and source throughput. This information is updated upon permit renewal in the District’s Data Bank. Criteria pollutant emissions calculated by using throughput data of the specific materials, emission factors based on various test data and publications, operating times, batch cycle variables, and control equipment reduction factors. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are produced during the fermentation process of beer production and in the combustion of organic emissions from coffee and cocoa beans in abatement devices, such as an afterburner. The CO2 emissions emitted from beer production is considered biogenic. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated to be the same throughout the year due to the variety of processing facilities. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county. 4.5.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1987) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment data. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment data.

Foundries and forges process ferrous (iron based) metals, non-ferrous (i.e. aluminum, copper, magnesium, zinc, brass, and bronze), or a combination of both. Metal recycling and shredding facilities collect, sort, and recycle scrap metal. Scrap Metal includes both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and is often shredded. Point sources (Categories 34 and 2222) include various process equipment associated with the foundry, forging and metal recycling and shredding operations. These equipment include furnaces (cupola, electric arc, reverberatory, etc.), temporary mold and core making, metal casting, cooling, shakeout, and sand reclamation, shredders, etc. These equipment are subject to District regulations and the permit system. However, there may be some exempt sources for which permits are not required that are also considered point sources. Emissions associated with these two categories are PM and TOG. In addition to point sources, various other processes and emission sources at these facilities, such as tapping pouring and casting, cooling, shakeout, metal management, sorting separation, open spaces, etc. are the primary sources of fugitive emissions. The fugitive PM emissions from these processes and sources are considered area sources (Categories 2221 and 2223). Methodology Categories 34 and 2222 contain PM and TOG emissions from point sources only. These point source emissions are calculated from operating data submitted for each equipment as part of the permit approval process. Parameters and variables include throughput, emission factors, operating times, batch cycle variables, and stack parameters. For control equipment, the weight percent reduction factors for each pollutant account for emission reduction. Throughput is updated upon permit renewal. The PM and TOG emissions for the point sources are contained in the permit data bank and the summation of these emissions provide the emissions for these categories. Categories 2221 and 2223 contain PM emissions from area sources. Fugitive PM emissions from Category 2221 were estimated using a BAAQMD engineering analysis of PM emission at four of the larger foundries and forges within the District The fugitive PM emissions at three of these facilities were estimated to be between 60% - 85% of the total (fugitive and abated) PM emissions. The fugitive PM emission at other facility, though small, was estimated from its recycling activity. The fugitive emissions and throughput from these facilities were used to estimate an emission factor. This emission factor along with reported throughputs from the smaller foundries and forging facilities within the District provided fugitive PM emissions from these sources. In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2221 was estimated to be 0.61 ton/day. District staff used an engineering analysis of fugitive PM emissions from a recent CEQA analysis conducted for a new facility in West Sacramento, California to estimate fugitive PM emissions from Bay Area scrap metal recycling facilities (Category 2223). In 2011, the fugitive PM emission from Category 2223 was estimated to be 0.12 ton/day. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions for these categories is assumed to be uniform (i.e. does not vary) throughout the year. County Distribution For point and area sources, information on the location of each facility was known and the emissions were distributed to the counties accordingly. 4.6.2 Trends History The historical growth profiles were based on a combination of prior emissions data and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing &amp; Wholesale Employment growth profile. Control In 1963-1970, the particulate emissions were reduced due to the control imposed by Ringlemann requirements from Regulation 6. Currently, there is an estimated 98.5% overall control of particulates from Category 34 and over 99% for Category 2222. On May 1, 2013, Regulation 12, Rule 13 (Miscellaneous Standards of Performance, Foundry and Forging Operations) was passed. For Category 34, organics will be reduced by approximately 42%, beginning May 1, 2015.

Industries engaged on these operations include manufacturers of plywood, particleboard, hard board, and furniture. Methodology This category contains emissions from both point (Category 35) and area sources (Category 1907). Wood waste generated as particulate matter is removed from the wood working operations mainly for housekeeping purposes, by either a cyclone or a baghouse. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plant by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The point sources account for the majority of emissions from this category. It was estimated that area sources account for 20% of the total throughput from this category. The area source total particulate emission factor was assumed to be 20 pounds/ton wood processed.

["cement-manufacturing-combustion.html", "4.8 Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion", " 4.8 Cement Manufacturing &amp; Combustion 4.8.1 Emissions Introduction The primary criteria pollutant emission from cement manufacturing is particulate matter. Particulate matter at cement plants are generated during quarrying, crushing, grinding, blending, drying, transfer process, and storage of cement. The largest single source of emissions is the kiln. The cement industry generally uses mechanical collectors, electric precipitators, or baghouses to control emissions. The most desirable method of disposing of the dust collected by an emission control system is injection into kiln burning zone for inclusion in the clinker. Various fuels are used in the kiln for the cement manufacturing process. These fuels have included coke, coal, and natural gas. (As of 2010, coal was no longer as a fuel in the kiln.) Diesel fuel is used in the emergency generators and portable compressors. The emissions from these fuels are the five criteria pollutants, namely PM, organics, NOx, SOx, and CO. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), is also produced during the cement manufacturing process. Carbon Dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are the GHG’s emitted during the combustion of the fuels. Methodology These categories contain criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from point sources only. Emissions were individually calculated for each source operation in the District’s Data Bank System. Emissions are calculated by multiplying the specific emission factor for a particular source operation by the throughput. These data are supplied by the permitted facility. The summation of these emissions provides the emissions for these categories. The CO2 emission factor used in the cement manufacturing process was obtained from the California Climate Action Registry’s Cement reporting Protocol. The combustion sources (coke, natural gas. and diesel) GHG emission factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O were obtained from the Department of Energy (EIA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC). Monthly Variation Monthly and daily production rates follow permitted data supplied by the major cement manufacturer. County Distribution Emissions are distributed to the county based on the location of the processing plant. The District’s data bank contains the information on plant location in Santa Clara County 4.8.2 Trends History The historical growth profile for Category 36 was based on a combination of prior cement kiln throughput data (back to 1987) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. The historical growth profile for Categories 1747 - 1750 was based on a combination of prior fuel throughput data (back to 1999) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. Growth Projections of emissions to 2030 in all categories were based on ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment growth profile. Control Two federal rules address air emissions from Portland cement manufacturing, namely New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS). For specific industrial operations (such as cement manufacturing), EPA addresses criteria pollutants from new, modified and reconstructed sources through NSPS. NESHAP address emissions of hazardous air pollutants from both new and existing sources. The cement manufacturing operations are subject to District regulations regarding permitting (Regulation 2-1 and Regulation 2-2), emissions of toxic or hazardous compounds (Regulation 2-5) and some regulations for individual pollutants. For example, [Regulation 6-1] reduces particulate emissions from the control imposed by Ringleman requirements. The District adopted Regulation 9-13, Nitrogen Oxide, Particulate Matter, and Toxic Air Contaminants from Portland Cement Manufacturing, on September 17, 2012. This rule becomes effective on September 9, 2013 and limits the emissions of NOx, PM, and toxic air contaminants. The categories criteria pollutant’s overall control efficiencies (CE) as a result of this rule are listed below: For Category 36, the overall CE of PM increases slightly, to over 99%.; the overall CE of organics is approximately 14%. For Category 1747, the overall CE of NOx is 42%; the overall CE of organics is approximately 45%. For Category 1749, the overall CE of NOx is 42%; the overall CE of organics is approximately 62%.

["contaminated-soil-aeration.html", "4.9 Contaminated Soil Aeration", " 4.9 Contaminated Soil Aeration 4.9.1 Emissions Introduction Category 37 accounts for organic emissions from contaminated soil aeration events. Contaminated soil aeration occurs when soil containing organic compounds is excavated and allowed to vent into the open air. These events include underground gasoline tank removal, soil excavation during pipeline leak repairs, and removal of other organic and petroleum chemical spills. Methodology The District requires a written report for any soil aeration activity. These reports were evaluated to determine a generalized emission factor for each event as well as to estimate the total number of excavations. Regulation 8, Rule 40 allows up to 150 pounds per day of organic compound emissions per aeration event. The organic compound emissions factor was calculated assuming the aeration site starts emitting at 120 pounds per day, with emissions halving every ten days, and with emissions set at zero at the 90th day. Two tank removals or replacements are also assumed to occur per aeration event. On average, about 250 excavation events take place annually in the Bay Area. County Distribution The county activity distribution is based on an average number of aeration events in each county in the District. Monthly Variation The monthly factors are assumed to be uniform. More aeration events are assumed to start during weekdays than during weekends. 4.9.2 Trends History State regulations governing the construction standards of gasoline holding tanks required many stations to replace their existing tanks. In our Source Inventory of 1987, the District had 152 excavation events reported. In 1990, this number had grown to 1254. The number of excavations remained above 1100 per year through the mid 1990s. Growth Much of the increase since 1987 had been due to the Porter and Cologne Act regulated by the State Water Resources Control Board and California Regional Water Quality Control Boards. Parts of these underground tank regulations govern the replacement of underground storage tanks. The California Code of Regulations, Title 23, Division 3, Chapter 16 stated that by December 22, 1998, all underground storage tanks containing hazardous substances, other than those containing motor vehicle fuels, need to be retrofitted with secondary containment. By the same date, motor vehicle fuel tanks made of steel needed to be retrofitted with secondary containment or be provided with both interior lining and exterior cathodic protection. The number of excavation events remained at close to the 1990 rate through 1998 and declined afterwards. Control The District adopted Regulation 8, Rule 40 on February 15, 1989. The overall control afforded by this rule is 81%. This rule applies for soil aeration events only. Air stripping and soil excavation events are inventoried in category 937, under Regulation 8, Rule 47. Rule 40 sets the rate of uncontrolled aeration in addition to describing an acceptable soil aeration procedure. For an uncontrolled aeration, an operator may not aerate the soil at above certain rate per day; however, the soil aeration may be extended over many days. This does not reduce the total emissions from an aeration event. By: Sukarn Claire Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Soil and groundwater contamination are the result of leaking underground storage tanks, accidental spills and landfill leachate. Air stripping process is commonly used for contaminated groundwater remediation. Contaminated groundwater is pumped into the air-stripping tower. A blower generally exhausts the effluent air stream from the stripping column. The contaminated air stream is routed to an air pollution control device (i.e., carbon adsorbers). Soil vapor extraction is one of the techniques to extract volatile organic compounds (VOC) from contaminated soil through the use of a vacuum system. Fresh air is injected into the subsurface at locations around the contaminated area. The contaminated air is withdrawn under vacuum from extraction wells. This contaminated air is then vented directly to a VOC treatment system such as carbon adsorbers, thermal incinerators, catalytic incinerators, and condensers prior to being released to the atmosphere. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. Point source emissions are calculated from each equipment’s operating data submitted as part of the permit approval process. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor developed by district staff engineer is used to determine emissions. Monthly Variation The data bank contains percentage of throughput data for each of the four 3-month seasonal periods: (December - February, March - May, June - August, September - November). County Distribution The data bank system contains information on the county location of each processing plant; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. 4.10.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1996) and the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile.

Wastewater streams normally are introduced into the POTW collection system through individual or area drains, which can be open to the atmosphere or sealed to prevent wastewater contact with the atmosphere. Emissions are emitted from wastewater collection, treatment, and storage systems through volatilization of organic compounds at the liquid surface. Methodology Category 50 (POTW) contains organic emissions from point sources only. The emissions in this category are from municipal wastewater treatment plants. All plants operating in the District are in the Data Bank System. The Data Bank contains throughput information submitted by individual plants by sources. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these permitted POTW facilities in Category #50 come from combustion sources only. These GHG, namely CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O are calculated in the combustion source categories (i.e. Category Nos. 291, 292, 304, 307, 312, etc.). Other process and fugitive GHG emissions (CH4 and N2O) from POTW facilities are estimated as an area source in Category 1911. The CH4 emissions from POTW’s (centralized anaerobic) and the N2O emissions from wastewater treatment effluent emissions and biological denitrification were estimated using the California Air Resources Board’s Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (4th Edition, Category: Waste, IPCC: 4D1 – Wastewater Treatment and Discharge). These area source GHG emissions were estimated for the BAAQMD as a whole and not to any specific POTW facility. Monthly Variation The data bank contains percentage of throughput data for each of the four 3-month seasonal periods: (December - February, March - May, June - August, September - November). This throughput data was uniform throughout the week for both categories. County Distribution The county location of each processing plant as reported in the databank is used to distribute emissions into each county for Category 50.

Categories 1157 and 1158 account for organic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from point and area source landfills, respectively. Category 1157 (Point Source Landfills) also has particulate emissions from activities such as vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping, etc. Categories 1686 and 1687 account for point source criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and GHG emissions (CO2, Biogenic CO2, CH4, and N2O) from the combustion of landfill gases from flares and internal combustion engines (ICE), respectively, at landfills. Landfill gas may also be combusted in ICE’s outside landfills; however, they are covered in Categories 303 (Reciprocating Engines—Gas Fuels) and 305 (Turbines—Gas Fuels). Landfill gas production rates and compositions vary greatly, even within a single landfill. There are no comprehensive data leading to the development of generalized emission factors for the Bay Area. Biodegradation takes place over an extended period of time, therefore, waste generated in prior years must be considered for emissions calculations. It is assumed it takes 15 years for maximum biodegradation to take place. However, biodegradation occurs, to a lesser extent, 35 years and beyond. (For emission calculation purposes in Categories 1157 and 1158, 40 years for biodegradation was used.) Prior to the mid-1960’s, it was assumed that 60% of the waste was buried in landfills and 40% of the waste was burned on-site. After that it was assumed the burned waste was diverted to the landfills. Methodology Point Sources It is assumed all active landfills within the District are permitted sources. Inactive landfills less than 30 years old and have greater than one million tons of refuse in place are also considered permitted. These permitted landfills are considered to be point sources; their throughput and emission information has been inventoried in the District’s database since the early 1980’s. Although most point source landfills have collection systems associated with them, there are several landfills that do not have a collection system. Landfills with Collection Systems For those landfills with active collection systems, it is assumed that 25% escapes as fugitive landfill gas 75% of the gases are captured and are either destroyed by flaring or burned in an internal combustion engine (ICE) or turbine. Those captured gases that are flared or burned in an ICE or turbine are accounted for and reported to the California Air Resources Board (CARB) under our combustion “C” sources. The following are a list of source codes associated with the criteria pollutant and GHG emissions from landfills with collection systems: G7145511. The throughput associated with this source code represents the amount of landfill gas collected for a particular year. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive methane and GHG emissions from this source based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas collection system captures 75% of the total amount of landfill gas generated at the site (AP-42, Chapter 2.4); the remaining 25% of landfill gas is assumed to be fugitive emissions. Landfill gas, on average, contains 55% methane (CH4), 40% carbon dioxide (CO2), with the remaining 5% nitrogen, oxygen, non-methane organic compounds, etc. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (Category: Managed waste Disposal Sites, Sector: Industrial: Landfills, not specified). Constants used in the emission factor calculations are as follows: The standard molar volume of gases is 387.006 scf/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CH4 is 16.043 lbs/lb-mole. The molecular weight of CO2 is 44.010 lbs/lb-mole. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Combustion Sources Using Landfill Gas. The assumed 75% landfill gases captured are combusted in the “C” sources by flaring or used as fuel in turbines or IC engines. A 99% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed for flaring operations; a 97% destruction efficiency of TOG is assumed when landfill gas is burned in an internal combustion engine. A slightly higher TOG destruction efficiency, 99% or more, is achieved in turbines. Particulate, NOx, SOx, and CO emissions are also considered as products of combustion. Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions are also calculated from these combustion sources. The CH4 and CO2 emission factors were based from both EPA AP-42 and District sources. The N2O emission factor was based on California Energy Commission data. The CO2 emissions emitted from these combustion sources are considered to be biogenic. G7145580. This source code represents the fugitive ROG emissions with throughput given as the amount of refuse as tons-in-place. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145540. This source code represents fugitive ROG emissions from the on-site handling of contaminated soils. This soil is usually contaminated from gasoline or diesel, and the units associated with this material code are in tons/yr. There are no methane or GHG emissions associated with this source. G7145466. This source code represents particulate PM10 emissions from landfill activity that includes vehicle traffic on unpaved roads, bulldozing, scraping and dumping activities, wind erosion from land cover, etc. Throughput is based on tons of incoming waste for a particular year. Landfills without Collection Systems For those few landfills without collection systems, the following is the source code associated with this type of landfill: G7159580. The throughput from this source code represents the total tons in place of refuse. The District uses the throughput and emission factor data to calculate the fugitive organic and GHG emissions from this type of landfill based on the following assumptions: The landfill gas generation rate (LGR) of methane is dependent upon the age of landfill, moisture content, type of refuse, etc. and will vary from landfill to landfill. The landfill gas composition for these types of landfills is approximately 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Area Sources Area sources consist of inactive landfills that had less than 1 million ton of refuse in place. These landfills were closed many years ago and data is very limited. In 1999, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 10% of the total waste in place. In future years, this value will decrease linearly because of less contribution from these area sources. In 2008, it was estimated area source throughputs comprised 7.75% of the total waste in place. The assumptions used estimate criteria pollutant (organics) and GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions listed below: The LGR of methane for these closed landfills was 0.030 mcf/year – ton-in-place. The landfill gas composition for area source landfills is similar to point source landfills without collection systems, namely 50% CH4 and 50% CO2. (There is additionally a small amount of ROG, but for calculation purposes assume the equal percentage split.) The constants used in emission factor calculations are the same as those used for Source Code G7145511. The ROG factor for area source landfills is the same as for point source landfills at 0.0089. In accordance with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and EPA GHG inventory procedures, 10% of the CH4 fugitive landfill gas is oxidized into CO2. The N2O emission factor was provided by CARB in their Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory. The CO2 emissions from this source are considered to be biogenic. Monthly Variation Estimated daily emissions are assumed to be uniform for all months of the year. This is due to burial/insulation of the refuse that reduces impact of ambient temperature changes, allowing somewhat uniform biodegradation throughout the year. County Distribution Point Source Categories (Cat. Nos. 1157, 1686, and 1687) The data bank system contains information on the county location of each landfill; hence, emissions are distributed to the counties accordingly. It is assumed San Francisco County has had no landfills within their boundaries; therefore, their refuse is transported to the other counties. Area Source Category (Cat. No. 1158) The county fractions were based in the number of closed landfills (not accounted for by the District) in the in each county. This data was obtained from the Solid Waste Information System (SWIS) at CalRecycle’s website (http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov). 5.2.2 Trends History &amp; Growth Category Nos. 1157 and 1158’s historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Population growth profile, Percentage of cumulative waste generation attributed to point or area source, Per capita waste generation, and Overall collection efficiency of the landfill gas. As mentioned previously, prior to the mid-1960’s, it was assumed 60% of the waste was buried in landfills (point source) and 40% of the waste was burned on-site, as in backyard incinerators. By 1999, it was assumed that 90% of the cumulative waste generation was attributed to point sources, and the remaining 10% was attributed to area sources. By 2030, it is assumed the point source percentage will increase linearly to 97.75% and the area source percentage will decrease linearly to 2.25% Since the State of California passed a mandate (Assembly Bill 939) that required a reduction in waste generation, per capita waste generation in the District has decreased. Until 1990, this factor was approximately 1.32 tons/person/year; in 2008, it had decreased to 0.79 tons/person/yr. By 2030, it is assumed the per capita waste generation in the District will decrease linearly to 0.70 tons/person/year. In addition to what was previously mentioned, Categories Nos. 1686 and 1687 historical and projected growth factors were based on the following: Prior to 1984 (the year Reg. 8, Rule 34 was passed), it was assumed all landfill gases were emitted as fugitive emissions. By 1996, the overall collection efficiency at landfills was assumed to be 75%, with 25% of the landfill gases emitted as fugitive emissions. Between those two years, the collection efficiencies were interpolated. Control Currently, Regulation 8, Rule 34 (Solid Waste Disposal Sites) requires that certain landfills process landfill gases through a gas collection and emission control system such that: There are no leaks that exceed 1000 PPM by volume measured as methane at any component or connector of the landfill gas collection system; and The collected gases are process in an enclosed ground type flare with a TOG destruction efficiency of at least 98% by weight; or The collected gases are processed in an energy recovery device or emission control system that reduces the amount of TOG by at 97% by weight.

["land-farming.html", "5.3 Land Farming", " 5.3 Land Farming 5.3.1 Emissions Introduction Land farming is a process in which waste (biosolids), primarily from dried sewage sludge, is deposited and spread on rural, open lands. Greenhouse gas emissions, namely methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) were also calculated for this category. Methodology Emissions for this category are calculated by multiplying the annual activity (throughput) value for a particular year by the emission factor in question. The annual activity (throughput) for this category was obtained from the March 2009 report “Bay Area Biosolids Management: Challenges, Opportunities, and Policies.” The amount of biosolids generated in in the Bay Area in 2007 was estimated to be 158,000 dry tons. Approximately 19% of that amount, or 30,020 dry tons, was “land applied” for Land Farming purposes. The Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Total Population growth profile was used to obtain the 2011 throughput value of 31,028 dry tons/year. The emission factor for reactive organic gases (ROG) was obtained from the California Integrated Waste Management Board Contractor’s Report to the Board, “Emissions Testing of Volatile Organic Compounds from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the Sab Joaquin Valley”, October 2007. The ROG emission factor for greenwaste /food scrap composting ranged from 1.3 – 2.6 lbs./ton composted. A mid- point value of 1.95 lbs./ton was used. A ROG factor of 0.8689 was used to calculate the total organic gas (TOG) emission factor. This ROG factor was obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District for greenwaste composting. The TOG emissions factor of 2.24 lbs./ton was calculated by dividing the ROG emission factor by the ROG factor. The CH4 emission factor of 0.29 lbs./ton was calculated by subtracting the TOG emission factor by the ROG emission factor. The N2O emission factor of 1.1997 lbs./ton was obtained from the 2006 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste. Monthly Variation For monthly variation, the emissions are distributed evenly throughout the year. County Distribution Data attributing the throughput activity to the various Bay Area counties was obtained from the March 2009 report “Bay Area Biosolids Management: Challenges, Opportunities, and Policies.” 5.3.2 Trends History Until the early 1990’s, land farming consisted of wastes more from the industrial sector. Most of these industrial wastes are now transported outside the District to be spread on the land. Prior to 1990, the growth was based on the ABAG’s 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Between 1990 and 1993 growth was interpolated. Growth Emissions after 1993 are assumed to grow at a rate similar to the population as provided by ABAG’s 2009 Population growth profile.

["composting.html", "5.5 Composting", " 5.5 Composting 5.5.1 Emissions Introduction Composting is a biological process where organic materials, such as leaves, grasses, etc., are decomposed by microorganisms to create a nutrient-rich, soil-like material. Composting most often takes place in aerobic conditions, however, under certain conditions, composting can occur under anaerobic conditions. These conditions include compost pile structure and density, particle size, low oxygen supply, moisture content, low oxygen supply, etc. Methane emissions increase under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, proper monitoring and management are very important to maintain aerobic conditions for efficient composting operation. The composting process includes the following steps: Feedstock Preparation, Composting, Curing, Screening, and Storage. In the feedstock preparation step, the composted organic materials are screened and, if required, processed in a grinder to achieve the best composting conditions. This mixture is then placed in rows or piles where the decomposition process begins. The initial phase of composting, lasting for about one month is very active and generates temperatures high enough to kill weed seeds and pathogens. After this “active” phase, the material is cured at a slower rate and temperature. During this phase, the moisture content is reduced and a more stable product is produced. Once the compost is cured, the material is screened to produce the desired product and then stored prior to final distribution and use. Methodology In 2011, there were approximately 32 composting facilities1 in the Bay Area. Ten (12) of these facilities are permitted by the District and considered point sources (Category 1709). The point sources contain annual activity (throughput) information for each applicable source that is stored in the District’s Data Bank. Reactive organic (ROG) emissions are then calculated by using emission factors (generalized or specific) and control factors, if any, for a particular source operation supplied by the company. Some related compositing activity (i.e. windrow and storage activities, etc.) are also permitted and particulate emissions are calculated. Note: The composting operations that involve mushroom farming were not included in this count. The 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National greenhouse Gas Inventories does not assign mushroom farm media preparation to the waste sector for emission inventory development. It falls under the Industrial Processes and Product Use, Food and Beverage Industry, or Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use, manure Management, Poultry (3A2i). The other approximate 20 facilities are considered area sources (Category 1936) where annual throughput, criteria pollutant emission factors (TOG and ROG), and control activity (if any) are estimated. The TOG and ROG emissions are calculated by multiplying the throughput by the emission factor and, if applicable, the control factor. Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emission, namely methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O), are also associated with composting activity. The CH4 and N2O emissions are calculated similarly to the criteria pollutant emissions mentioned above. The throughput and emissions factors (TOG, ROG, and GHG) estimates were developed based on the following: Throughput Data For those composting facilities not permitted by the District (area sources), throughput data was provided by industry and CalRecycle officials or using CalRecycle’s Solid Waste Information System’s (SWIS’s) database. The throughput information provided in the SWIS database represents maximum allowable throughputs. The actual throughput was estimated to be 60% of the SWIS database value. The units for throughput information should be in tons per year, however, they may appear in other units, such as cubic yards per year (yd3/yr), cubic yards per day (yd3/day), tons per day, etc. For those throughputs that required a conversion factor to tons, the following bulk density values were used: Greenwaste – 3.54 yd3/ton Mixed (greenwaste mixed with food, manure, etc.) – 2.24 yd3/ton The above conversion factors were taken from the California Integrated Management Board (CIWMB) Report, “Third Assessment of California’s Compost and Mulch Producing Infrastructure”, May 2009. For throughputs that were in a volume per day format, it was assumed most facilities operated 260 days per year. However, for some facilities, this value may vary slightly. Emission Factors The Reactive Organic Gas (ROG) emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.85 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 1.95 lbs/ton The emission factors above were cited in the October 2007 CIWMB study, “Emission Testing of VOC from Greenwaste Composting at the Modesto Compost Facility in the San Joaquin Valley.” The mid-point value for each of the emission factors was used. Total Organic Gas (TOG) emission factors were calculated by dividing the ROG emission factors by a ROG factor. A ROG factor, obtained from data compiled by the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District (SJVAPCD), of 0.8689 was used. The TOG emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.98 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 2.24 lbs/ton Methane (CH4) emission factors were assumed to be the difference between the TOG and ROG emission factors. The CH4 emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.13 lb/ton Greenwaste/Food Scrap (assume as mixed) – 0.29 lbs/ton The Nitrous Oxide (N2O) emission factors varied from 0.12 to 1.1997 lbs/ton and were obtained from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, Chapter 4, Biological Treatment of Solid Waste. The N2O emission factors used for emission calculation purposes are listed below: Greenwaste – 0.12 lb/ton Greenwaste, including food – 0.6599 lb/ton Mixed (greenwaste, manure, etc.) – 1.1997 lbs/ton Emission Calculation The TOG, ROG, CH4, and N2O annual emissions for an area source (Category 1936) facility were calculated by multiplying the estimated throughput by the respective pollutant emission factor. Monthly Variation The emissions are assumed to be distributed evenly throughout the year. County Distribution The county distribution was based on the location as found in the District databank or SWIS data mentioned above. 5.5.2 Trends History It was assumed composting in the Bay Area began in the mid-1980’s (1985 was used as the starting point). There was limited information in prior years, so it was assumed throughput activity exhibited a linear decrease from 2005 back to 1985. From 2005 – 2008, the growth was based on the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Total Population growth profile. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on the ABAG’s 2009 Total Population growth profile. Control Currently, there is no District rule regulating emissions from compost facilities. However, there are several facilities in the Bay Area with in-vessel composting where it is assumed there is an overall VOC control efficiency of 90%.

There are numerous intermediate products in a refinery including liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline, kerosene, diesels, and fuel oils. The waste products include wastewater, spent acids, and oily sludge. Categories 55-58 contain point source emissions from refineries tanks, and categories 84- 85 account for point souce emissions from tanks at other sites. Category 940 accounts for point source emissions from cleaning of all storage tanks. Category 1902 and 1903 accounts for area source emissions from storage tanks. Storage tanks at bulk plants and gasoline stations are inventoried in sections 6.4 and 6.9, respectively. Methodologies The categories for storage tanks contain emissions from both point and area sources. Tank emissions are calculated using equations and emission factors from U.S. EPA’s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emisssion Factors, AP-42, Volume I: Station Point and Area Sources. The primary criteria pollutant emitted from storage tanks include hydrocarbon vapors or volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The predominant types of storage tanks found in a refinery include: Fix roof tanks External floating roof tanks Internal floating roof tanks Conservation tanks, pressure tanks, and others The types of tank along with the following parameters (given below) are used to calculate emissions. Tank diameter Paint factor Tank height Vapor space Temperature change Tank volume Throughput Stored material Factors specific to stored material Point source emissions are obtained from the District’s data bank system. The data bank contains information submitted by the individual refinery by tank sources. Area Source emissions are derived based on an estimated ratio between area and point source throughputs via tank type. Monthly Variation and County Distribution The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information for each category. 6.1.2 Trends History Historical emissions have varied with refinery throughputs. Growth Projected growth for all refinery related categories was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2011) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to remain relatively flat. This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected. Control Regulation 8-5 controls emissions from the storage of organic liquids. Control efficiencies are estimated to range from 17% to 96%, depending on the type of tank, percentage of sources with true vapor pressures above 0.5 psi, and average true vapor pressure of the corresponding category. The following table show the control and rule efficiencies. (Sources with true vapor pressure greater than 0.5 psi are affected by this rule.)

["natural-gas-distribution.html", "6.3 Natural Gas Distribution", " 6.3 Natural Gas Distribution 6.3.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions associated with the transmission of natural gas are mostly fugitive organic emissions that occur due to the leaks in pipeline. Components such as valves, flanges, pumps, compressors, and pressure relief valves (PRVs) are the potential leak sources. Categories 61 and 868, account for fugitive organic emissions including methane (CH4) from natural gas distribution system in the San Francisco Bay Area. Emissions from Pacific Gas and Electric’s (PG&amp;E’s) pipeline system that distributes natural gas for its own use are covered in Category #61. Emissions from PG&amp;E’s pipeline system that distributes natural gas to residential, commercial and industrial customers are covered in Category #868. Methodology Fugitive emissions occur from leaks in the pipeline distribution system. Prior to 1990, an emission factor of 0.7% by volume of gas distributed was used. This factor was based on the South Coast Air Quality Management District report “Estimated Fugitive Emissions from Natural Gas Transmission for Calendar Year 1979”, July, 1980. Since 1990, an emission factor of 0.2% has been used for both distribution systems: PG&amp;E’s own usage (Category #61) and PG&amp;E’s customers (Category #868). This emission factor is based on the 1990 PG&amp;E report titled “Unaccounted-For Gas Project”. Emission Factors in pounds per thousand cubic feet of gas (lb/MCF) are shown below. Categories Total Organics (TOG) Methane (CH4) 61, 868 88.0 85.4 County Distribution County distributions for Category #61 and #868 are based on natural gas usage data obtained from the California Energy Commission (CEC), PG&amp;E, and City of Palo Alto. Temporal Variation The daily, weekly and monthly emission rates are considered to be uniform. 6.3.2 Trends History In general, emissions increase as activity increases and emissions decrease as activity decreases. In recent years, emissions for category #868 have been increasing, while emissions for category #61 have been on the decrease due to PG&amp;E’s divestments in power plants. For Base Year 1983, all natural gas distribution losses were handled as a single category which had been designated as Category #43. The category has been subsequently split into two categories (#61 and #868) since Base Year 1987. For Category #61 up to base year 2008, it was assumed that annual emissions would tend to follow two components: services industry employment and population by county in the District. As such, a hybrid growth profile was developed based on 50% of the appropriate county services industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate county population value in combination with CEC’s natural gas data. For Category #868 up to base year 2008, it was assumed that annual emissions would tend to follow: manufacturing industry employment and population by county in the District in combination with CEC’s natural gas consumption forecasts. As such, a hybrid growth profile was developed based on 50% of the appropriate county manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate county population value in combination with CEC’s natural gas data. For previous forecasts, the employment and population data was obtained from the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 “Projections” reports. Growth Annual demand for natural gas varies in response to business conditions and annual temperatures but has been generally declining or flat over recent years. This is due in part to historically low number of heating degree days and building and appliance efficiency standards, utility and public agency programs, and price and other effects. This trend is projected to continue with a population growth at a faster rate than total demand for natural gas. By: S. Claire Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

["gasoline-truck-transport.html", "6.7 Gasoline Truck Transport", " 6.7 Gasoline Truck Transport 6.7.1 Emissions Introduction Gasoline truck transit losses are similar in many ways to breathing losses associated with petroleum storage. The gasoline is transferred by tank trucks from refineries and bulk plants for delivery to end user outlets. Emissions depend on the vapor tightness of the tank, the pressure relief valve settings, the pressure in the tank at the start of the trip, the vapor pressure of fuel being transported, and the degree of fuel vapor saturation of space in the tank. Methodology This category accounts for the organic emissions occurring in transit while transporting fuel by tank trucks. Emissions from gasoline cargo tanks include the fugitive emissions and emissions from maintenance. The emission points are from pressure-related fugitive (Cat#1600, Cargo Tank) emissions from the cargo tank fittings and valves, vapor hoses (Cat#1601, Loading-Return Vapor Hoses) after loading into the underground tank, and wetted wall emissions from the product (Cat#1602, Loading-Main Hoses). Pressure-related fugitive (Cat#1600, Cargo Tank) emissions are volatile organic vapors leaking from fittings, valves and other connecting points in the vapor collection system on a cargo tank. Pressure inside the cargo tank is caused by solar and reflective heat gains. Due to these heat gains, vapors inside the cargo tank expand and exert pressure to the tank walls, fittings and valves. Emissions from the vapor hose (Cat#1601, Loading-Return Vapor Hoses) are a result of vapors trapped inside the hose after product delivery to the underground tank. Some vapors condense inside the hose. When the hose is disconnected from the underground tank and truck fittings, the vapors and condensed vapor inside the hose are emitted into the ambient air. Emissions from the product hoses (Cat#1602, Loading-Main Hoses) are a result of residual product clinging to the walls of the hoses. Residual liquid, inside the hose, vaporizes into the ambient air resulting in emissions. This methodology is presently based on CARB’s methodology. TOG emission factors are listed below: Pressure-Related (Cat#1600) Losses: 0.588 lbs per 1000 gallons, Vapor Hose (Cat#1601) Losses: 0.024 lbs per 1000 gallons, Product Hose (Cat#1602) Losses: 0.133 lbs per 1000 gallons.

The amount of spillage loss can depend on the service station business characteristics and nozzle types (conventional nozzle or vapor recovery nozzle). Methodology This category accounts for evaporative emissions resulting from spillage gasoline dispensing facilities (GDFs). The estimates of gasoline consumption in the Bay Area were provided by California State Board of Equalization, Fuel Taxes Statistics &amp; Reports and Caltrans Transportation Planning Support Information System (TPSIS). These estimates were made by adjustments of Gasoline Dispensing Facility sales, population, number of registered vehicles, and the number of drivers’ license.

Monthly Variation The monthly variation of emissions was based on monthly California taxable sales data from the Board of Equalization. County Distribution Emissions distributed into the nine counties were based on Caltrans Transportation Planning Support Information System’s breakdown. 6.8.2 Trends History Historical emissions were based on past years Bay Area gasoline consumption. Prior to 1990 Base Year, taxable gasoline sales for California obtained from the Board of Equalization were assumed to distribute to all gasoline filling stations in California. ARB estimated that Bay Area consumed 20.01% of this state total. The emissions for this category were determined according to this estimated throughput. Growth Gasoline consumption in 2007 reached record levels. However, the gasoline consumption decreased slightly during the economic recession in 2008 - 2010. Projections are based on future gasoline consumption in the Bay Area. The Air Resources Board (ARB) is in the process of updating the emission factors for GDFs’ categories: gasoline storage and transfer operations from cargo tank trucks to GDFs and from GDFs to vehicles, fuel containers, and gasoline-powered equipment. With the current requirements of the CARB’s Phase II Vapor recovery systems regulations, the GDF categories’ emissions will be greatly reduced for forecasted emission years. Control Emissions were reduced due to the improvement of vapor recovery nozzle in Phase II Gasoline Dispensing Facilities. Regulation 8 rule 7 does not specify emission reduction for this category. However, the improvement of the vapor recovery nozzles reduces spillage at vehicle filling services stations. By: Michael Nguyen Date: January, 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["petprod-GDF-storage.html", "6.9 Gasoline Filling Station Storage", " 6.9 Gasoline Filling Station Storage 6.9.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from gasoline dispensing facilities (GDF) are generated when gasoline vapors in the underground storage tank are displaced to the atmosphere by the gasoline being loaded into the tank. The emissions are due to breathing (vapor expansion and contraction of liquid in the tank) and working (from filling and emptying the tanks). Breathing losses occur as a result of dinural temperature and pressure variations. Working losses occur as fueling from underground storage tanks, fresh air is entered into the tank through the vent. Because this entering air is not at equilibrium with the liquid in the tank, evaporation of liquid occurs. Most gasoline dispensing facilities (GDF) in the Bay Area were equipped with Phase I and/or Phase II vapor recovery systems. Phase I vapor recovery system employs a dual hose that recovers gasoline vapor back to the tank truck during the filling of underground tanks. The integral part of Phase II vapor recover system is the vapor recovery nozzle and hose that efficiently collect the displaced vapors. Methodologies These categories account for organic emissions associated with the storage of fuel at gasoline service stations (or GDF). The estimates of gasoline consumption in the Bay Area were provided by California State Board of Equalization, Fuel Taxes Statistics &amp; Reports and Caltrans Transportation Planning Support Information System (TPSIS). These estimates were made by adjustments of Gasoline Dispensing Facility sales, population, number of registered vehicles, and the number of drivers’ license. The throughput for each type of GDF was estimated based on the information contained in the District’s data bank. The 2011 gasoline consumption in the Bay Area was 7,041 thousand gallons per day. Emission factors were taken from AP-42, Section 4.4. The total emissions for area source categories are determined by multiplying the emission factor, control factor and throughput. Monthly variation Monthly variation of emissions was based on gasoline usage data for California. The monthly Bay area gasoline usage was estimated from Board of Equalization Taxable Gasoline Sales monthly report. County Distribution Emissions distributed into the nine counties were based on Caltrans’ Transportation Planning Support Information System’s breakdown. 6.9.2 Trends History Emissions for these categories had been reduced due to Phase I and II vapor balance system requirements since 1975. Prior to 1990 Base Year, taxable gasoline sales for California obtained from the Board of Equalization were assumed to distribute to all gasoline filling stations in the California. ARB estimated that Bay Area consumed 20.01% of this state total. The emissions for this category were determined according to this estimated throughput. Growth Gasoline consumption in 2007 reached record levels. However, the gasoline consumption decreased slightly during the economic recession in 2008 - 2010. Projections are based on future gasoline consumption in the Bay Area. Control Emissions were reduced due to the effect of Regulation 8, Rule 7, Phase II requirements and the following actions: In July 1976, California Health &amp; Safety Code required CARB certified 90% Phase II gasoline dispensing facilities. In August 1978, CARB amended Phase II GDF to 95% efficiency. In July 1986, CARB issued “Rectification Orders”. In October 1990, District adopted pressure-vacuum valve requirements for GDF. In January 1992 , Re-formulated Gasoline, Phase I , and In January 1999, Re-formulated Gasoline, Phase II. In March 2000, California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted a series of new Enhanced Vapor Recovery (EVR) amendments to its gas station vapor recovery regulations (Phase I and Phase II). In addition, CARB adopted new standards: to make vapor recovery system compatible with on-board vapor recovery (ORVR) systems on motor vehicles, to reduce gasoline spillage, liquid retain in the nozzles, and to pressure-related fugitive emissions. The adopted amendments also include mandatory In-Station-Diagnostics (ISD), which are requiring electronic monitoring of vapor recovery system operation and performance.

Over-the- wing and single point pressure fueling are two systems used by airports for refueling aircraft. The over-the-wing is similar to a service station without a vapor recovery system. Single point pressure systems use pressure and a closed connection to refuel aircraft. The gasoline vapors in the aircraft tank are vented into the atmosphere through vents on the wings. Other sources of emissions for these categories are also from working and breathing of the underground storage tank during refueling. Methodologies The amount of aviation and jet fuel usage from San Jose International Airport and Oakland International Airport were obtained from the airport’s Monthly Activity Report. The fuel usage at the other airports was determined by apportioning the Oakland Airport usage with the number of operations. The uncontrolled emission factors of gasoline service station are used for refueling with gasoline over-the-wing. The emission factors are chosen based on EPA, AP-42 publication and engineering judgment. Total organic emissions for aircraft refueling categories are determined by multiplying the emission factor and estimated throughput.

Emissions result from vapor displacement to the atmosphere. Methodology Fuel usage from Ships and Tugboats were estimated based on the number of ships data provided by the San Francisco Marine Exchange (see also Ships Categories). It was assumed that about 30 % of the fuel used by ships and tugboats were pumped in the Bay Area. Emission factors for gasoline station are used to calculate emissions. Fuel usage from Ferry boats were obtained from the major ferry and cruise operators in the Bay - i.e. the Golden Gate Bridge District (Ferry Division), Blue and Gold, and Red and White Fleet (see also Ferry Boats Category). Of the total registered boats, it was assumed that 75% were used for fishing activities. It was assumed further that an average of 4 hours was used per trip. Fuel rate was estimated at 5.24 gal per hour for an average engine size of 140 HP engine at 80% power load. Fuel usage was estimated based on this for the Fishing boats category. For recreational boats, the amount of fuel usage was estimated based on a KVB Study on gasoline use tax, the number of boats per DMV registration. Total organics emissions are determined by multiplying the estimated fuel usage in each of the category activity and the emission factor. Monthly Variation Emissions from the Recreational Boats Fueling category were distributed into the nine counties based on KVB’s report on “Inventory of Emissions from Boating Sources in California.” Monthly emissions variations for the ships, ferry, and fishing boats fueling were estimated partly based on the ferry boats schedule and with the highest usage in the summer months.

Methodologies The ARB estimated alternative fuel usage as 8% by on-road vehicles, 10% by other internal combustion engines, 8% by farm equipment, and 74% by residential/commercial sources. About 18% of the total state usage, or approximately 94,814 thousand gallons (propane), came from the Bay Area. The emission factor used was based on fuel tests by the Western Propane Gas Association which showed an average of about 0.263 grams of total hydrocarbon per liter of fuel. This converts to about 2.193 lbs. of total organics per thousand gallons of fuel. Monthly Variation Since activities on this category are heavily during recreational use, monthly variation was estimated similar to the recreational boats category, with the highest usage during the summer months.

Ethylene Oxide is widely used due to its ability to kill microbes in difficult to reach places. Category 92 and 1577 account for point and area sources from medical sterilizers in the Bay Area, respectively. Methodology Point Source Category 92 contains point source emission data reported to the District’s permitting department. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the companies Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the companies through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may supplied by companies also) The county, month, and day factors are obtained from the data bank’s information on each plant’s location, seasonal usage, and days per week of operation. The point source emissions at present are less than 0.01 tons/day of reactive organics. Area Source Category 1577 accounts for non-permitted ethylene oxide emission sources. In 1987, about 206,000 pounds of ethylene oxide was estimated as area source emissions. Because most of these sources are now permitted sources due to Regulation 11 Rule 9, the amount of area source emissions is estimated to have dropped to 1050 pounds of sterilizer gas. Emission factor used for ethylene oxide is one. Therefore, all of the ethylene oxide used is emitted as organic emissions. 6.16.2 Trends History Actual emissions from the District’s permitted sources were used for historical years. Growth Growth of ethylene oxide use in sterilizers is estimated to follow population growth. The population data used for growth profiles was obtained from the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 “Projections” and the California Statistical Abstracts.

Rapid-cure Liquid Asphalt (Rapid-cure Cutback Asphalt) is no longer used in the Bay Area. Rapid-cure Liquid Asphalt was formerly Category 94. Medium-cure Liquid Asphalt (Medium-cure Cutback Asphalt) may be used in the Bay Area provided the atmospheric temperature does not exceed 500F for 24 hours after application (per BAAQMD Regulation 8-15, Sections 302 and 112.) This restriction greatly limits the application of this type asphalt; therefore, the organic emissions from Medium-cure Liquid Asphalt are considered negligible. Slow-cure Liquid Asphalt (Slow-cure Cutback Asphalt) may also be used in the Bay Area with restrictions (per BAAQMD Regulation 8-15, Section 304). Slow-cure Liquid Asphalt is synonymous with “Road Oils” (Category 95). Methodology The organic emission from asphalt paving operations in the Bay Area was based on ARB’s methodology for emission calculations (Attachment C: Asphalt Paving and Roofing, from STI’s Area Source Emissions Updates, March 2003). In 2011, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Office of Oil and Gas reported 10,589,000 barrels of asphalt were used in California for paving and roofing purposes. Of that amount, it was assumed 80% (8,471,200 barrels) of the asphalt was used for road paving and 20% (2,117,800 barrels) was used for roofing. (To calculate asphalt usage in tons per year it was assumed an asphalt density of 8 lbs/gal and a barrel equivalent to 42 gals.) Additionally, the statewide asphalt use for paving applications was estimated as follows: Hot-mix: 88% Emulsified: 9% Road Oils: 2% Cutback: &lt;1% (Note: It is assumed some districts, including the BAAQMD, do not use Rapid-cure Cutback Asphalt.) County throughputs can be apportioned from the state’s total using the miles of paved roads in each of the counties. This data was acquired from the States’ Teale Data Center. The organic emission factors used for hot-mix, emulsified, and road oils were 0.04, 17.9, and 2.19 lb/ton of asphalt applied, respectively. (Note—the initial emission factor used for road oils was 88 lbs./ton. This was an EPA recommended value; however, regulatory controls reduced this value to the level stated above.) The total emissions for area source categories are determined by multiplying the emission factor, throughput, and rule effectiveness factor, if applicable. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on estimates of construction activities in a year. County Distribution County activity was based on miles of paved roads in each county as acquired from the Teale Data Center. 6.17.2 Trends History Since the early 1980’s, the Asphalt Institute has done the reporting of asphalt sales and road oils.

This category estimates organic emissions from roofing operations; however, it does not include the manufacture of roofing materials, nor does it cover emissions from fuel combustion. The organic emission from asphalt roofing operations in the Bay Area was based on ARB’s methodology for emission calculations (Attachment C: Asphalt Paving and Roofing, from STI’s Area Source Emissions Updates, March 2003). Methodology In 2011, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) Office of Oil and Gas reported 13,703,000 barrels of asphalt were used in California for paving and roofing purposes. Of that amount, it was assumed 80% (8,471,200 barrels) of the asphalt was used for road paving and 20% (2,117,800 barrels) was used for roofing. Individual county throughputs can be apportioned from construction activity that was provided to ARB. (For the Bay Area, the fractional total to the state was approximately 0.2573.) The 2011 throughput for the BAAQMD was 544,836 bbls/yr (or 95,423 tons/yr, assuming density of asphalt at 8.34 lb/gal).

["dry-cleaning.html", "6.20 Dry Cleaning", " 6.20 Dry Cleaning 6.20.1 Emissions Introduction In the dry cleaning process, washing is conducted by agitating the fabric in a solvent bath. The next step is extraction where excess solvent is removed by centrifugal force. In the final step, drying is conducted by tumbling the fabric in a stream of warm air to vaporize and remove the solvent from the fabric. When the washing and extraction steps are performed in one machine and drying in a second machine, it is referred to as a transfer operation. When one machine performs all three steps, it is referred to as a dry- to-dry operation. Coin-operated dry cleaning machines, which are directly available for use by the consumer, typically involve dry-to-dry operations. These dry cleaning facilities emit organic emissions resulting from the use of solvent in cleaning process. The organic emissions may either be reactive (i.e. Stoddard solvent) or nob-reactive (i.e. perchloroethylene). The amount of emission depends on the equipment type, amount of cleaning performed and operating practices. Dry cleaning equipment includes washers, dryers, solvent stills, muck cookers, still residues, and filter muck storage areas. Emissions may also come from leaks from pipes, flanges and pumps. The most common dry cleaning synthetic solvent in use today is perchloroethylene, or PERC, a non-reactive organic material, but considered toxic (Category Nos. 105 and 1912). However, PERC usage in dry cleaning operations will be phased out by the year 2023. Category Nos. 105 and 1912 represent PERC usage in point and area sources, respectively. Other than PERC, there are currently no other halogenated solvents (Category #106) used in the District. The other cleaning solvents used are the non-halogenated petroleum solvents (Category Nos. 107 and 1913). These include both reactive solvents (i.e. Stoddard Solvent, DF- 2000, etc.) and non-reactive solvents (i.e. siloxane). Category Nos. 107 and 1913 represent non-halogenated petroleum solvents usage in point and area sources, respectively. Methodologies Most of the dry cleaning facilities in the Bay Area are covered under the District’s Permit system. Emissions are calculated by using solvent throughput information of each source reported by individual companies in the District’s Data Bank system, called point sources. Emission factors used were based on tests and other data publication. Those dry cleaning facilities not covered under the District’s Permit system are considered area sources. For Category 1912, the area source emissions are assumed to be 10% of the point source emissions. In 2012, most dry cleaning facilities using non-halogenated petroleum solvents were re- classified as registered sources in the District’s Data Bank. As a registered source, a facility must use 100 gallons, per year, or less, of non-halogenated petroleum solvent material. These registered sources are now classified as area sources (Category 1913). (An additional 5% of the number of registered dry cleaners will be added to include those dry cleaning facilities that did not report to the District.) Those dry cleaning facilities using greater than 100 gallons per year of non-halogenated petroleum solvents are considered point sources. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on each facility’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. County Distribution The county location of each facility reported in the Data Bank is used to distribute emissions into each county for Categories 105 and 107. The county fractions for these two categories were also used to their respective area source portions, namely Categories 1912 and 1913. 6.20.2 Trends History Prior years’ emissions were estimated using the Association of Bay Area Governments’ (ABAG’s) Population growth profile. This growth profile was modified to reflect the emissions data between the years 1987 – 2011. Growth Over the past years, PERC usage has decreased significantly. This decrease is the result of several factors, one being its toxicity. Dry cleaners have been switching to other cleaners, such as non-halogenated hydrocarbon solvents. In March 2008, amendments to District Regulation 11, Rule 16 (Rule 11-16) phases out all PERC usage in dry cleaning operations by 2023. The cumulative PERC reduction (listed below) was used in developing the growth profile for Categories 105 and 1912 that represents this phase out: Year Reduction Cumulative CY2008 18.57% 18.57% CY2009 18.57% 37.14% CY2010 18.57% 55.71% CY2011 1.43% 57.14% CY2012 4.90% 62.04% CY2013 3.88% 65.92% CY2014 8.16% 74.08% CY2015 6.73% 80.81% CY2016 8.98% 89.79% CY2017 4.90% 94.69% CY2018 1.43% 96.12% CY2019 1.63% 97.75% CY2020 0.82% 98.57% CY2021 0.41% 98.98% CY2022 0.20% 99.18% CY2023 0.82% 100.00% The phase out of PERC will increase usage of the non-halogenated petroleum solvents (Category Nos. 107 and 1913). As mentioned previously, most dry cleaning facilities using non-halogenated petroleum solvents were re-classified as registered sources (i.e. area sources) and thus reflected in the growth profiles for Categories 107 and 1913. After 2012, the growth profiles for these two categories were based on data from a 2009 BAAQMD staff report on dry cleaner emissions projections (Figure IV-A1 of the January 2009 Staff Report for Reg. 2, Rule 1, Reg. 8, Rules 17 and 27, and Reg. 11, Rule 16) and ABAG’s Population growth profile. Control The District originally adopted District Regulation 8-27, for Synthetic Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations as an ozone control measure in May 1980. This rule was amended in March 1982, November 1984, and September 1990 with additional operating requirements. In 1994, the District adopted Regulation 11-16 to incorporate new regulatory standards adopted at the state and federal levels. Regulation 11-16, with its new solvent standards and control requirements, replaced Regulation 8-27. Regulation 8-27 was retained as part of the District’s regulations for State Implementation Plan (SIP) considerations, however, in March 2009 was deleted. District Regulation 11-16 (Perchloroethylene and Synthetic Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations), passed in December 1994 required more stringent requirements on controls, monitoring, ventilation, secondary controls, and certain prohibition of usage of certain machines. In March 2009, Regulation 11-16 was amended to incorporate into the District rule a state law phase out schedule that would eliminate the use of Perchloroethylene in dry cleaning by January 1, 2023. District Regulation 8-17, adopted in May 1980, set operating and emission control requirements to dry cleaning operations using petroleum solvents. In March 1985 and September 1990, this rule was amended to reflect additional control and operating requirements. Some of the newer alternative technologies currently available include some non-halogenated photochemical organic compounds (POC) and non- photochemical organic compounds (NPOC). To reflect the expanded applicability of this rule and update the equipment standards and control requirements, Regulation 8-17 was amended again in March 2009. The title of this rule was also changed from “Petroleum Solvent Dry Cleaning Operations” to “Non-halogenated Dry Cleaning Operations”. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],

["adhesive-sealants.html", "6.22 Adhesive Sealants", " 6.22 Adhesive Sealants 6.22.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in these categories are fugitive organic emissions resulting from the usage of adhesives and sealants. Adhesives and sealants are primarily used in wood, wood-related, and packaging activities. The emissions reported in these categories include emissions resulting from both industrial and consumer usage of adhesives and sealants. Emissions from categories 117 and 118 include point sources. Category 118 emissions are from area sources. Adhesives and sealants are generally categorized and distinguished by source types. Most adhesives and sealants are either of a water-based type or of a solvent-based type. Adhesives and sealants can also be found, although in a smaller quantity, in the form of hot melts (100% solids), radicured, powders, and reactive types. Raw materials primarily used in the production of adhesive and sealants are rubber, starch, animal glues, bitumen, and synthetic resins. Other materials of smaller quantity that can be found in adhesive and sealant formulations include phenolic resins, formaldehyde, polyolefins, polyvinyl acetate, acrylics, polyvinyl chloride, polyesters, polyvinyl alcohol, and solvents, including hexane, heptane, xylene, toluene, methylene chloride, and 1,1,1-trichloroethane. Methodologies Permitted Facilities Companies utilizing large amounts of adhesives/sealants are monitored and regulated by the District’s permit system. Throughput of adhesive and sealant usage for each permitted facility are tracked and recorded in the District’s Data Bank system. Some of the industries affected under the District’s permit system for the usage of adhesives and sealants include large wood production manufacturers, wood related construction companies, and packaging companies. Emissions are calculated based on throughput data and emission factors. Emission factors used in the calculation are either derived from field tests and/or obtained from publications. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor is used in the calculation. Non-Permitted Facilities Emissions from adhesive and sealant used in non-permitted industries are estimated based on a geographical area. These emissions are termed “area source” emissions. Non-permitted industries includes construction sites, small industrial companies, transportation facilities, dental and medical buildings, electric and electronics facilities, and other miscellaneous sites. Data used to estimate area sources are based on “The Rauch Guide to the U.S. Adhesives and Sealants Industry, 2000-02 Edition”. Adjustments were made for 2008 using both the construction growth for each county in the Bay Area and the Rauch Guide’s projection. Emission factors used in the calculation of these area sources were taken from ARB’s report titled “Adhesives and Sealants”. The emission factors used in the calculations were 1,230 lbs. of VOC per ton of solvent-borne adhesives/sealants and 90 lbs. of VOC per ton of water-borne adhesives/sealants. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on each company’s reported quarterly seasonal percent throughput data. County Distribution The county location of each company as reported in the Data Bank was used to distribute emissions for each county. 6.22.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated based on ARB’s growth data on the construction industry. Growth Projections to year 2030 were based on the same growth profile of ARB’s construction industry in the Bay Area. Control District Regulation 8-51 set limitation standards on adhesive products effective January 1995 and assumed to have 60% control effectiveness.

Emissions from this category are from various sources and different industrial processes. The emissions for these point sources are contained in the permit data bank. Methodology This category contains emissions from point sources only. Point source emissions are calculated from a facility’s equipment operating data submitted as part of the permit approval process. The Data Bank contains throughput information from sources submitted by individual plants. Emissions are then calculated by using specific emission factors for a particular source operation supplied by the company. If no specific factor is available, a generalized factor developed by district staff engineer is used to determine emissions. Monthly Variation The data bank contains throughput data for each month provided by companies holding District permits. County Distribution Emissions distributed into counties were based on actual locations of the plants in the Bay Area. 6.25.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data and the California Air Resources Board Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Growth Future projections of emissions to 2030 are based on the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 Manufacturing Employment growth profile. Control Sources in this category may be subject to Regulation 8-4 (General Solvent &amp; Surface Coating Operations). The purpose of this Rule is to “limit emissions of volatile organic compounds from the use of solvents and surface coatings in any operation other than those specified by other Rules of the Regulation 8.” Originally passed in 1980, this rule has been amended several times—the latest being in 2002 regarding surface preparation standards.

["vacuum-truck-at-refinery-marine-bulk-terminals.html", "6.26 Vacuum Truck at Refinery, Marine, Bulk Terminals", " 6.26 Vacuum Truck at Refinery, Marine, Bulk Terminals 6.26.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions reported in this category are from the operations of vacuum trucks at refineries, marine, and bulk terminals in the San Francisco Bay Area. A vacuum truck is a transportable, truck-mounted, industrial vacuum system designed to load materials into the truck’s containment vessel. Vacuum trucks are capable of loading different types of materials (either pneumatically, by external pump or by gravity feed) into their barrels under a variety of conditions. Methodologies Emissions are calculated based on throughput and source test data. Throughput data, when available, are obtained from refinery records. Source test data is taken from monitoring measurements during field studies. Because of the wide variation in test results and because most facilities do not closely track quantities of materials moved by vacuum truck, estimates of emissions and emission reduction for vacuum truck involve significant uncertainty. To determine quantities of materials moved in each category, data was taken for one refinery and scaled for other facilities to arrive at the total. Monthly Variation Monthly variation for the vacuum truck category was assumed to be uniform throughout the year. County Distribution With major refinery, marine, and bulk terminal presence, Contra Costa and Solano counties have the largest vacuum truck operations of all the San Francisco Bay Area counties. 6.26.2 Trends History Vacuum truck historical growth rate was based on data from studies and historical records. Growth Projected growth for vacuum truck at refineries, bulk, and marine terminals is related to refinery growth. For all refinery related categories, growth was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2007) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to increase at a rate of approximately one percent per year. Control Vacuum truck is regulated under District’s Regulation 8, Rule 53 which established an emission limit that applies at the vapor exhaust outlet of the vacuum truck or associated equipment. The rule also establishes a limit for vapor leads and for liquid leaks from vacuum truck equipment. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

Natural gas consists of a high percentage of methane (generally above 85 percent) and varying amounts of ethane, propane, butane, and inert gases. The combustion of natural gas in the residential sector is broken down into three categories: Space Heating, Water Heating, and Cooking. Categories 283, 284, and 285 account for area source emissions from Space Heating, Water Heating, and Cooking, respectively. Design of residential boilers and furnaces generally resemble fire tube type boilers with flue gas traveling through several channels or tubes with water or air circulated outside the channels or tubes. Methodologies Total natural gas usage for these categories was obtained from the California Energy Commission (CEC), the Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E), and the city of Palo Alto. This total natural gas usage was broken down into three categories based on information from CEC and PG&amp;E, and is shown below. Category Category Percent 283 Space Heating 57.3% 284 Water Heating 38.5% 285 Cooking 4.2% Emission factor information for natural gas combustion was obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the California Energy Commission (CEC).

Information on Palo Alto’s natural gas usage was obtained separately from the City of Palo Alto and was used together with Santa Clara County natural gas usage values. This was done because the city obtained gas from a supplier other than PG&amp;E. Solano and Sonoma Counties are partially in the San Francisco Bay Area Air District, so data were used for the cities that are in the District. For Solano County, data used were for Benicia, Fairfield, Suisun and Vallejo; for Sonoma County, data used were for Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and Sonoma. Temporal Variation Space Heating Daily Activity: The maximum activity occurs in the early daylight hours and in the evening hours, with average activity during the day and low activity at night. Weekly Activity Code: The activity is uniform seven days a week. Monthly Activity: The monthly activity was based on monthly residential natural gas sales from the California Energy Commission. Activity occurs from November to June, with the highest months being December through April. Water Heating Daily Activity: The maximum activity occurs in the early daylight hours and in the evening hours, with average activity during the day and low activity at night. Weekly Activity: The activity is uniform seven days a week. Monthly Activity: The monthly activity is assumed to be uniform throughout the year.

Household population data was obtained from two sources, the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 “Projections” reports and the California Statistical Abstracts. Control The District adopted Regulation 9; Rule 6 on April 1, 1992 to control the amount of NOx emissions from natural gas fired water heaters.

Methodology Emissions estimates from domestic LPG and distillate oil combustion are based on the “BTU equivalent - natural gas approach”. This approach follows an ARB methodology as given in a document titled, “Methods for Assessing Area Source Emissions in California”, Section 5-3. The approach is based upon, namely: Number of housing units heated by LPG and distillate oil as provided by the 2010 Department of Finance’s Census of Population and Housing. Bay Area natural gas fuel usage as provided by Pacific Gas and Electric Company. Natural gas usage conversion to average BTUs per household. Estimation of LPG and distillate oil usage based on average BTUs per household. Calculation of LPG and distillate oil emissions. Greenhouse gas emission factors are obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Monthly Variation The monthly variation for LPG and distillate oil was based on data provided by PG&amp;E Customer Accounting Department. This data details domestic natural gas usage by number of customers (dwelling units) in each county. For all counties except Solano and Sonoma, data sets reflecting the entire counties were used in the calculation. For Solano and Sonoma Counties that are both partially in the District, only data for cities within the District were used. For Solano County, data sets used were for Benicia, Fairfield, Suisun and Vallejo. For Sonoma County, data sets used were for Cotati, Petaluma, Rohnert Park, Santa Rosa, Sebastopol and Sonoma. County Distribution County distribution of emissions was based on the Department of Commerce’s 2010 Census of Population and Housing for California. In that report, the number of homes using LPG and fuel oil as a heating medium were used in the estimate of county distribution. 7.2.2 Trends Historical Growth For Category 286 (Fuel Combustion, Stationary Sources, Domestic LPG), an assumption was made that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow household population data. Population data used in the projection was based on the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 “Projections” report. For Category 287 (Fuel Combustion, Stationary Sources, Domestic Distillate Oil), the growth was assumed to be diminished as the fuel would eventually be phased out in favor of natural gas. A 2% reduction per year was chosen, starting in 1992. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["domestic-solid-fuel-wood.html", "7.3 Domestic Solid Fuel (Wood)", " 7.3 Domestic Solid Fuel (Wood) 7.3.1 Emissions Introduction This methodology is used to estimate the criteria pollutant emissions from residential wood combustion, namely from fireplace and woodstove. Fireplaces are the most commonly utilized wood burning device in a home. They are used primarily for supplemental heating and for aesthetic appeal. Fireplace combustion is characterized by high air-to-fuel ratios and burn rates. Traditional masonry fireplaces typically contain large open fireboxes without combustion air controls and are not highly efficient heating devices. A net heat loss may occur in a residence if colder, outside air is drawn in to replace the inside air used for combustion and lost through the chimney draft. There are also prefabricated (metal) fireplaces which are slightly higher in energy efficiency than masonry fireplaces. Fireplace inserts that fit into the fireplace can increase the heating efficiency by either radiating the heat into the house or venting heated air into the house by air circulating around the insert with the help of a fan. Woodstoves are used primarily as domestic space heaters and have enclosed fireboxes and dampers to reduce air-to-fuel ratios and burn rates. Since they are stand-alone heating devices, the greater surface area radiates more heat than a fireplace. The emissions from residential fireplaces and woodstoves are highly variable, depending on the amount of wood burned and the types of woodstoves and fireplaces being used for burning wood. Many assumptions were made with the realization that any variations in one or more of these variables would substantially change the calculations. Methodologies The emission estimates for woodstoves and fireplaces were derived from BAAQMD’s wood burning survey performed between winter of 2005 and spring of 2006. This survey was performed by True North Research. Data collected from this survey includes wood burning activities via frequency, fuel type, and quantity for the Bay Area nine counties. A compilation and analysis of this data was performed by Dr. David Fairley, BAAQMD’s statistician, in a report entitled “Revised Estimates of Wood Burning in the San Francisco Bay Area Based on Telephone Survey Data”. Statistical estimation methods were used in this report to derive the annual and seasonal amount of wood burned by county. Throughputs were also derived based on data obtained from the survey. A density of 5 lbs per unit of log was assumed in the calculation. Wood stove and fire place emission factors were based on data obtained from ARB and EIIP volume IV. Composite emission factors were calculated for wood stove criteria pollutants based on an average of conventional and EPA phase II wood stove emission factors. The number of conventional versus EPA phase II wood stoves were derived based on a statistical analysis from the 05-06’ winter survey. In addition to criteria pollutant emission, greenhouse gases for wood smoke are also reported in the emission inventory. Wood smoke carbon dioxide emissions are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio-CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. Wood smoke greenhouse gas emission factors are obtained from the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s), Energy Information Administration (EIA). Monthly Variation The monthly variation for wood burning in woodstoves and fireplaces was also derived from Bay Area’s 2005-2006 telephone survey on wood burning. Monthly variation was estimated based on sample weights assigned from the data analysis. The estimates were appropriately adjusted for county population. County Distribution There were wide county differences in the amounts of wood burned. For fireplaces, the more urban counties – Alameda, San Francisco and San Mateo – tend to have lower amounts burned per household than counties in more rural parts such as Sonoma and Napa counties. However, because of the large populations, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara were estimated to contain the largest quantity of logs burned per area. For wood stoves, Sonoma, Marin and Napa have the largest household number of logs burned per household but, again because of population, the largest number of logs burned in wood stoves per area was found in Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. 7.3.2 Trends Historical Growth Future projections of emissions are based on household growth in the Bay Area from 2009 “Projections” report published by ABAG. Control Control of residential wood combustion currently falls under EPA’s Standards of Performance for New Stationary Sources (NSPS) for residential wood heater (stoves). (This is adopted by reference in the District Regulation 10.) The NSPS required that new residential heaters manufactured on or after July 1, 1988, or sold on or after July 1, 1990 be certified to meet particulate emission standards of 5.5 grams per hour for catalytic wood heaters and 8.8 grams per hour for non-catalytic wood heaters. These are known as Phase I stoves. More restrictive particulate emission standards were set for stoves manufactured on or after July 1, 1990 or sold after July 1, 1992. For catalytic wood heaters this was 4.1 grams per hour and for non-catalytic wood heater this was 7.5 grams per hour. These are known as Phase II stoves. Although EPA has only set emission limits for particulate matter, emission of reactive organic compounds and carbon monoxide are expected to be limited as well. Natural gas fireplaces, pellet fueled wood stoves, and EPA-certified woodstoves and fireplaces are increasing in popularity every year. Particulate emissions from these heating devices are insignificant. Some cities and counties in the Bay Area have (or are looking at) enacting new ordinances restricting new wood stove and fireplaces to these low particulate emitting heating devices. In July 2008, the District enacted a rule (Regulation 6, Rule 3) to control emissions from wood-burning devices. This rule limits emissions of particulate matter (PM) and visible emissions (VE) from wood-burning devices, including any wood-burning device, pellet- fueled wood heater or any indoor permanently-installed device burning any solid fuel for aesthetic or space-heating purposes which includes fireplaces. The rule will help to reduce PM emissions from the burning of wood in woodstoves and fireplaces. By: Tan Dinh Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],
["cogeneration.html", "7.4 Cogeneration", " 7.4 Cogeneration 7.4.1 Emissions Introduction These stationary combustion categories (290, 291 and 292) account for criteria pollutant (particulate, organic, NOx, SOx, and CO) and greenhouse gas emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) from boilers, turbines, and reciprocating engines at cogeneration plants in the San Francisco Bay Area. Cogeneration plants are located at many sites in the Bay Area, including oil, chemical and food processing companies, municipal utility companies, hospitals, and military bases etc. Cogeneration plant is a power station that simultaneously generates both electricity and useful heat by utilizing one primary fuel. Modern, highly efficient power plants use the gas turbine Combined Cycle (CC). The combined-cycle gas turbine power plant consists of one or more gas turbines equipped with heat recovery steam generators to capture heat from the gas turbine exhaust. Steam produced in the heat recovery steam generators powers a steam turbine generator to produce additional electric power. Use of the otherwise wasted heat in the turbine exhaust gas results in high thermal efficiency compared to other combustion based technologies. Combined-cycle plants currently entering service can convert about 50 percent of the chemical energy of natural gas into electricity. Additional efficiency can be gained in combined heat and power (CHP) applications (cogeneration), by bleeding steam from the steam generator, steam turbine or turbine exhaust to serve direct thermal loads, such as food and chemical processing. Methodology Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data only, as contained in the District’s data bank. The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the plants Emissions factors (these may be source specific factors reported by the plants through source test results or applicable general factors, i.e. from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also) Information on these specific cogeneration sources allowed them to be identified as boilers, turbines or reciprocating engines. Some of these sources may be of the “dual fuel” type, i.e., they are able to combust either gaseous or liquid fuel. EPA’s document AP-42 contains emissions information on these types of sources. The fuel specific greenhouse gas emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). County Distribution The Bay Area Air District’s point source database contains county distribution information for each facility based on its location. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on the company reported quarterly throughput/ activity data. 7.4.2 Trends Historical Historical emissions have varied with fuel usage activity. Prior to Base Year 1987, these three categories were grouped as one category. Growth Projections for categories 290, 291, and 292 were developed based on the following methods in combination with the CEC’s forecasts for the combined heat and power generation demand. For Category #290 (boilers), it was assumed that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow two components: retail trade industry employment and services industry employment. As such, the annual variation ratio value was developed as a hybrid, based on 50% of the retail trade industry employment value and 50% of the services industry employment value. For Category #291 (turbines), it was assumed that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow two components: manufacturing industry employment and population within the District jurisdiction. As such, the annual variation ratio value was developed as a hybrid, based on 50% of the manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the population value. For Category #292 (reciprocating engines), it was assumed that emissions over the future years would tend to follow population growth. The employment and population data used were obtained from two sources, the Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) 2009 “Projections” reports and the California Statistical Abstracts.

All of the large steam turbine/boiler type electric power plants are located in San Francisco and Contra Costa counties. A power generation plant which converts heat energy of fuel combustion into electrical energy by utilizing a steam turbine and alternator, is known as a steam turbine power plant. Steam is produced in the boiler by combusting fuel. The steam is then expanded in the turbine to spin the steam turbine. The steam turbine drives the alternator which converts mechanical energy of the turbine into electrical energy. Emissions from the gas and oil fired turbines at power plants are contained in Categories 1595 and 297. Methodology Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data only, as found in the District’s data bank. Some of the boilers are of the “dual fuel” type, i.e.; they can either use natural gas (N.G.) or fuel oil. Presently only natural gas is used at the steam turbine/boiler type power plants. The Nitrogen Oxide (NOx) emission rates for the large steam power plants in the Bay Area have decreased over the years (from emission rate of about 0.15 lb. / MM BTU in 1990 to about 0.057 lb/ MM BTU in 2002). The District updates the data each year on a source-by-source basis using as input: Process material throughputs as reported by the power plants (this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the facility or general factors, i.e. from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)) Emission control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the power plants also) Information on the specific sources allowed them to be identified as gas fired or oil fired boilers. Many of these sources may be of the “dual fuel” type, i.e., they are able to combust either gaseous or liquid fuel. EPA’s document AP-42 contains emissions information on these types of sources. The fuel specific greenhouse gas emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). County Distribution The District point source database contains county distribution information for each facility based on its location. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on company reported quarterly throughput/activity data. 7.5.2 Trends Historical NOx emissions from 1980 through 2002 were based on actual fuel usage data provided by power plants operating in the Bay Area. Emissions over the years have fluctuated by a factor of about 2.5 based on external factors, such as amount of rainfall and the availability of low cost hydroelectric power during that year. The NOx emissions have varied from over 30 tons/day to as low as 10 tons/day. The fuel oil usage at the power plants has been decreasing over the years. Since 1996, electric utility power plants have been prohibited from burning fuel oil by District Regulation 9, Rule 11, except for emergency situations. The Bay Area boiler/steam turbine type power plant NOx emissions have decreased from historical (e.g., 1994) levels of over 30 ton/day to about 1 ton/day in 2007. This was due to shutting down of the older inefficient boilers and the stringent Best Available Retrofit Control (BARCT) requirements of Regulation 9-11 for existing utility power plants (0.057 Lb/MMBTU or 48 ppm in 2003, 0.018 lb/MMBTU or 15 ppm in 2005) and the Best Available Control (BACT) requirements of Regulation 2-2 for new power plants (0.0089 lb/MMBTU or 7.5 ppm). NOx emission concentrations are given in ppm by volume, dry basis at 15% O2. Growth Emission projections were developed based on the electric power generation fuel usage forecasts by the California Energy Commission (CEC).

Category 1596 contains estimates of fugitive emissions of Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) from power transmission and distribution system in the Bay Area. SF6 is an inorganic very potent greenhouse gas. SF6 is used in the electrical industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment. SF6 gas has a much higher dielectric strength than air or dry nitrogen that makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. Indirect greenhouse gas emission estimates from electricity imports to the Bay Area are accounted for in Category 1597. Emissions from gas and oil fired steam turbine/boiler type electric power plants are covered in Categories 293 and 294.

The fuel specific greenhouse gas (GHG) emission coefficients for these categories were obtained from the U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Energy Information Administration (EIA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) document AP-42, and the California Energy Commission (CEC). The SF6 emissions for Category 1596 were based on PG&amp;E’s Service Area total fugitive SF6 emissions. The SF6 emissions were apportioned to the Bay Area based on the Bay Area population as compared to total PG&amp;E Service Area population. Indirect GHG emissions from electricity imported to the Bay Area (Category 1597) were estimated based on total power consumption to power generated locally in the Bay Area. It is estimated that about one fourth to one third of electricity used in the Bay Area is imported from sources outside of the Bay Area. The emission factors (lb. /MWh) used in estimating emissions were in accordance with the PG&amp;E data. County Distribution The District point source database contains county distribution information for each facility for Category 297 and 1595. County distribution for Category 1596 and 1597 is based on population and power consumption, respectively. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on company reported quarterly throughput data for C297 and C1595. Uniform activity is assumed for C1596 and C1597. 7.6.2 Trends History Category 297 emissions prior to 1987 were derived from Base Year 1983 trend values. Historical emissions have varied with fuel usage activity. Emission projections for base years prior to 1996 were developed from natural gas and fuel oil usage estimates provided to the District by PG&amp;E. Growth Category 297 emissions projections for this base year were developed based on the electric power generation forecast by the California Energy Commission (CEC). In the long term, fuel oil usage is projected to be small. Category 1595 emission projections were developed based on the electric power generation fuel usage forecast by the California Energy Commission (CEC). Category 1596 emissions are not expected to grow so much as utilities have enrolled in voluntary SF6 emission reduction programs. Category 1597 emissions are expected to grow in accordance with CEC’s power consumption projections.

Methodologies Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data as found in the District’s Data Bank System. Each year, the District collects and records the data from individual refinery plants via a permitting process. The data is recorded using the following as inputs: Process material throughputs (as reported by the plants, this data is routinely updated) Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the plants or general factors, i.e. from the EPA) Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also) Emission information from numerous sources is grouped into the above mentioned categories. EPA’s AP-42, Chapter 5 contains description of petroleum refining processes and emission factors. Criteria pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are produced during refining processes. Since refinery emissions are part of point sources, criteria pollutants as well as greenhouse gas data are obtained from the refinery plant as part of the Bay Area Air District permit renewal process. The county, month, and day factors were derived based on information gather from a plant’s location, seasonal usage, and daily operation as found in the District’ Databank System. 7.7.2 Trends Historical Emissions prior to 1987 were derived from Base Year 1983 trend values. Past base year historical emissions include interchangeable emission reduction credits (IERC) which were part of category 10. IERC banking emissions are now inventoried under categories 298-300. Also, flare source emissions from categories 298 and 299 are now accounted for in category 15. Growth Projected growth for all refinery related categories was taken from the California Energy Commission report on California’s Petroleum Infrastructure (2011) that predicted California refiners expand distillation capacity to remain relatively flat. This is due to increase in fuel efficiency of vehicles from CAFÉ standards as well as steady transition to alternative fuels in the California market. California refiners have recently added and will continue to add more process units to produce reformulated gasoline. However, no large increases in emissions are expected from these units. Control Regulation 9-10 controls emissions of NOx due to external combustion. Significant reduction in NOx emissions was observed between the period from year 2000 to 2004 for refinery external combustion operations as a result of this rule.

Category #302 contains reciprocating engines for firewater pumps and standby generators at the oil refineries. Category 303 contains mostly internal combustion engines/electric generators at various companies and utility districts. Category 304 accounts for emissions mostly from diesel fuel engines. Most of the sources in this category are emergency or standby electric generators. Methodology Point Sources Emissions for categories 302, 303, and 304 were obtained from point sources only. The District’s permit requirement for engines was lowered to 50 horse powers or more. As a result, number of engines in the District’s inventory is expected to increase in the future.

County Distribution The District’s point source database contains county distribution information for each facility/source based on its location. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions is based on company reported quarterly throughput or activity data. 7.8.2 Trends History For Category 302, emissions have been extremely low and constant over the past years. Emissions for Categories 303 and 304 have generally varied with fuel usage activity in the San Francisco Bay Area. Growth Emissions for Category 302 are assumed to stay fairly constant in future years. For Category 303, it was assumed that annual emissions would tend to follow and be influenced by two components: manufacturing industry employment and population. As such, a growth profile was developed, based on 33.3% of the manufacturing industry employment value and 66.7% of the population value within the District. It is assumed that annual emissions from Category 304 would tend to follow and be influenced in roughly equal amounts by two components: manufacturing industry employment and population. As such, a growth profile was developed, based on 50% of the manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the population value within the District.

Category 1598 was added to account for additional emissions generated due to the increased use of emergency generators during the electric power shortage crisis in California (2001-2002). Category 304 contains emissions from normal usage of standby generators. These emissions from Category 304 are not covered here. Methodology Emissions due to increased emergency generator usage were estimated to be negligible during the electric power shortage crisis in California (2001-2002) and emissions are not expected to grow in the near future. The District collects fuel usage data each year on a source-by-source basis from facilities operating in the Bay Area. Emissions are calculated using fuel usage data and emission factors in the database.

Category 305 accounts for emission from gas fired turbines and Category 306 from oil fired turbines, respectively. A combustion turbine is a rotary engine that extracts energy from a flow of combustion gases. It has an upstream compressor coupled to a downstream turbine, and a combustion chamber in-between. The products of the combustion are forced into the turbine section. There, the high velocity and volume of the gas flow is directed through a nozzle over the turbine’s blades, spinning the turbine which powers the compressor and drives their mechanical output. Methodologies Emissions for these categories were obtained from point source data as found in the District’s Data Bank System. Each year, the District collects and records the data from individual plants via a permitting process.

As such, the annual variation ratio value for each year was based on the appropriate population value. Growth For Category #305, it appeared that sources at oil refineries made the greatest contribution to emissions. Therefore, the emission growth profile for this category is developed in the same manner as the oil refinery external combustion categories. This category is projected to grow at about 1 percent per year. Growth profile for Category #306 is assumed to follow population growth.

Category 309 had been grouped as four categories before Base Year 1987 and Category 311 had been grouped as two categories. The historical trend values for categories 309 and 311 were summed, respectively, to build the historical emissions data. Growth For Categories 308 and 309, it was felt that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow and be influenced in roughly equal amounts by two components as follow: manufacturing industry employment and services industry employment by county, all within the District jurisdiction. As such, the annual variation ratio value for each year, for each county involved, was developed as a hybrid, based on 50% of the appropriate county manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate services industry employment value. For Category #310, it was felt that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow and be influenced mainly by manufacturing industry employment by county, all within the District jurisdiction. As such, the annual variation ratio value for each year, for each county involved, was developed to follow the manufacturing industry employment value. For Category #311, it was felt that annual emissions, over the years, would tend to follow and be influenced in roughly equal amounts by two components as follow: manufacturing industry employment and construction industry employment by county, all within the District jurisdiction. As such, the annual variation ratio value for each year, for each county involved, was developed as a hybrid, based on 50% of the appropriate county manufacturing industry employment value and 50% of the appropriate construction industry employment value.

Category 314 accounts for emissions from point sources in the Air District and emissions for category 1579 were obtained from area sources. Carbon Dioxide emissions from this category are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio- CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. These categories do not include emissions from the combustion of any “auxiliary fuel” (e.g. natural gas or fuel oil) used to maintain the elevated temperatures needed to promote combustion of the waste material being incinerated (Emissions from such “auxiliary fuels” are covered in categories #307, #309, #1590 and #1591). These categories also do not include emissions from solid fuel combustion for heating, cooking, or recreational purposes, which is covered in category #289. Methodology Point Sources The District updates the point source (Category 314) data each year on a source-by- source basis using as input the following: Process material throughputs as reported by the plants. Emissions factors (these may be source specific as reported by the plants or general factors, i.e. from the EPA). Emissions control factors (device-specific or general - these may be supplied by the plants also). Area Sources Area source emissions for category 1579 were calculated based on an estimated household waste generated in the Bay Area. Most of the household waste in the Bay Area is collected and disposed of at the waste landfills. About a third of a percent of the total waste generated the Bay Area is assumed to be burnt through illegal fires. The throughput (tons/year) was estimated by multiplying the Bay Area population by an average amount of waste production per resident. An average residential daily waste production of 1.6 pounds/person/day was used for the Bay Area.

Categories 315, 316, 317, 318, and 319 account for emissions from open burning of orchard prunings (such as grape vines, apples, and olives), field crops (such as wheat and oats), weeds (such as ditch and canal bank, and marsh burning), range improvement (such as chaparral and grass land burning) and forest debris, respectively. Carbon Dioxide emissions from these categories are considered to be biogenic emissions. Biogenic Carbon Dioxide (Bio-CO2) emissions are a subset of total CO2 emissions which are emitted from materials that are derived from living cells, excluding fossil fuels, limestone and other materials that have been transformed by geological processes. Bio- CO2 originates from carbon that is present in materials such as wood, paper, vegetable oils and food, animal, and yard waste. Methodologies Annual activity or waste material burn information for these categories was obtained from the burn permits issued by the District’s Enforcement Division for each county. Information on amounts of waste materials burned was provided to the District in various units such as acres, tons, pounds, and cubic yards. By applying the crop specific fuel loading factors and other conversion units, all burn activity was converted to tons of material burned per year. Emissions were calculated by multiplying the activity (Tons/Year) for a given category by its composite emission factor (Lb/Tons). Composite emission factors were developed using crop specific emission factor data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

The PM emissions result from construction operations such as digging, loading, scraping, grading, compacting, light duty vehicle traffic, etc. Emission factors were based on a study done by Midwest Research Institute. This study produced an average emission factor of 0.11 ton PM10/acre-month for these construction operations. (This value is assumed to include the effects of typical control measures, such as watering. Watering is assumed to control dust by 50%.) However, in the Bay Area, it was assumed 20% of construction activity consisted of large-scale operations that involved substantial earthmoving operations. Under this “worst-case” scenario, the emission factor was 0.42 ton PM10/acre-month. Therefore, the overall composite emission factor used for these construction activities in the Bay Area was 0.172 ton PM10/acre-month. It is assumed that all the above-mentioned construction operations have the same emission factor. The California Air Resources Board provided the PM speciation profile (PM10 fraction of 0.4893). Activity data (throughputs) are expressed in terms of acre-months for the above categories. Methodologies Residential Construction (Category 744) The number of new housing units (single and multi-family), provided by the California Department of Finance, is used to calculate the acreage disturbed. The affected construction area for a single family living unit is estimated at 1/7th of an acre for Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties; and 1/5th of an acre for Napa, Solano, and Sonoma counties. The affected construction area for multi-family living units is estimated to be 1/20th of an acre. The construction time for residential units is assumed to be 6 months. . The throughput, expressed in acre- months, is estimated by multiplying the appropriate area factors, construction time and number of new units for each county. Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional Construction (Categories 745 -747) The estimated construction acreage for these categories is based on project valuations supplied from the California Department of Finance. The valuations for commercial, industrial, and institutional construction are 3.7, 4.0, and 4.4 acres per million dollars of valuation, respectively. Since these factors are 1977 values, multiplying the above valuations by the ratio of 1977 to a particular year’s Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG’s) Consumer Price Index value makes inflationary corrections for that particular year. The construction time for commercial, industrial, institutional buildings is assumed to be 11 months. The throughput for a particular year, expressed in acre-months, is found by multiplying that year’s inflationary adjusted project valuation by the county’s construction valuation, and construction time. Road Construction (Category 748) The latest road construction for freeways, highways, county and city roads was estimated by the difference in their respective total mileage between that year’s and prior year’s data, as reported in the California Statistical Abstract. The affected area per mile of road for freeways, highways, and county and city roads are 12.1, 9.2, and 7.8 acres/mile, respectively. The construction time for roads is assumed to be 18 months for the average project. The throughput, expressed in acre-months, is estimated by multiplying the road construction miles, affected area per mile of road factor, and project duration time. The emission factor (which includes any controls) used for all categories mentioned above was estimated at 0.3515 ton PM/acre-month (703.0 lbs. PM/acre-month), with the PM10 fraction at 0.4893. The total emissions for these categories are determined by multiplying the throughput and emission factor. Monthly Variation The monthly variations of emissions for the Bay Area counties in Category 744 – 748 were based on the ARB’s seasonal profiles for Building and Road Construction Dust. Roughly, emissions were distributed as 55% during the months of April to September and 45% during the remaining months. County Distribution Distribution of emissions into counties was based on construction activity provided by the California Department of Finance. 10.1.2 Trends History The historical growth profile was based on a combination prior emissions data (back to 1987) and the ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment Growth Profile. Growth The projected emissions to 2030 for Categories 744 – 747 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment Growth Profile. For Category 748, the growth profile for the years 2008-2010 was based on information found in the California Energy Commission’s Report “Transportation Energy Forecasts and Analyses for the 2009 Integrated Energy Policy Report”, May 2010, Table 2.10. For these years, the activity decreased an average 4.3% per year to account for the downturn in the economy. After 2010, projected emissions to 2030 were based on ABAG’s 2009 Construction Employment Growth Profile. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],
["farming-operations.html", "10.2 Farming Operations", " 10.2 Farming Operations 10.2.1 Emissions Introduction Farming Operations consist of two categories, Agricultural Land Preparation (Category 749) and Agricultural Harvest Operations (Category 1435). The methodology for emission calculation and temporal activity for both these categories were taken from the California Air Resources Board’s (ARB’s) Emission Inventory Procedural Manual Section 7.4 (Agricultural Land Preparation, revised January 2003) and Section 7.5 (Agricultural Harvest Operation, revised January 2003). Category 749 accounts for particulate emissions generated by farming operations such as tilling, plowing, discing, leveling, etc. These activities are normally performed in the early spring and/or fall months. Therefore, particulate emissions from agricultural tilling are highly dependent on type of crop, climate, soil properties and equipment characteristics. Category 1435 accounts for particulate emissions caused from harvest activities. These activities include harvest vehicles traveling over the soil, mechanical processing of crop and underlying soil, or removal of crop waste material through blowing or sweeping action. As of this writing, the only crops in California that had harvest particulate emissions factors were almonds, cotton, and wheat. All other relevant crops are assigned emission factors by scaling from these three measured values. Emissions from fuel combustion of agricultural equipment, such as mowers, tractors, tillers, etc., are accounted for in Category 1655 (Agricultural Equipment, Gasoline-4 Stroke), Category 1656 (Agricultural Equipment, Evaporative-4 Stroke), and Category 1646 (Agricultural Equipment, Diesel). Methodology Category 749 Agricultural land preparation particulate emissions for each crop are estimated using the following equation: \\[ \\text{Emissions}_{crop} = \\text{Emission Factor}_{crop} * \\text{Acres}_{crop} \\] The crop specific PM10 emission factors are calculated by multiplying a land preparation emission factor (i.e. root cutting, discing, rippling, weeding, land planning, etc.) with the number of passes performed per acre that are needed to prepare a field for planting a particular crop (acre-pass). A crop may have multiple land preparation operations with its corresponding number of acre-passes. In this case, the crop specific emission factor is the sum of acre-pass weighted emission factor for each land preparation operation. For example, the crop PM10 emission factor for garlic is as follows: FIXME: RECREATE TABLE There are 21 crop specific PM10 emission factors (see Table 2.a of ARB’s Agricultural Land Preparation document) that include such crops as alfalfa, almonds, garlic, grapes (raisin, table and wine), tomatoes, wheat, etc. All other crops are assigned an emission factor from one of the 21 crop specific PM10 emission factors (see Table 3 of ARB’s Agricultural Land Preparation document). Example 1: Calculate the 2010 PM10 and total particulate emissions from land preparation activities for garlic in Santa Clara County, where the crop specific PM10 emission factor = 6.5 lbs PM10/acre/yr, 366 acres were devoted to garlic in 2010, and the PM10 factor is .4543. \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM}_{10}\\ \\text{emissions} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{6.5\\ lb}{acre \\cdot yr}\\times 366\\ acre \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 2379\\ lb/yr \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 1.19\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\end{eqnarray} \\] \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM emissions} &amp;=&amp; 1.19\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\div 0.4543 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 2.62\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM} \\end{eqnarray} \\] Each of the county’s crops are estimated in this fashion and then summed for the total PM10 emissions. The nine counties within the Bay Area were summed to get the District total. (The District’s portion of Solano and Sonoma Counties were 38% and 32%, respectively.) PM emissions are calculated by dividing PM10 value by 0.4543. Category 1435 Agricultural Harvest Operations particulate emissions for each crop are estimated using the following equation: \\[ \\text{Emissions}_{crop} = \\text{Emission Factor}_{crop} * \\text{Acres Harvested}_{crop} \\] The individual crop emissions for each county were summed to produce county and District wide total particulate and PM10 agricultural harvest emissions. The PM10 emission factors were taken from Table 2 of ARB’s Agricultural Harvest Operations document. Using the PM10 emissions factors for cotton, almonds, and wheat as a baseline, other crop’s PM10 emission factors were estimated. The number of acres to each applicable crop was obtained from either the county’s annual agricultural crop reports or the California Agricultural Statistics Service (CASS). Example 2: Calculate the 2010 PM10 and total particulate emissions from agricultural harvest operations for walnuts in Contra Costa County, where the Crop specific PM10 emission factor = 40.77 lbs PM10/acre, 399 acres were devoted to walnuts in 2010, and the PM10 factor is .4543. \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM}_{10}\\ \\text{emissions} &amp;=&amp; \\frac{40.77\\ lb}{acre \\cdot yr}\\times 399\\ acre \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 16267\\ lb/yr \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 8.13\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\end{eqnarray} \\] \\[ \\begin{eqnarray} \\text{PM emissions} &amp;=&amp; 8.13\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM}_{10} \\div 0.4543 \\\\ &amp;=&amp; 17.90\\ ton/yr\\ \\text{PM} \\end{eqnarray} \\] Each of the county’s crops are estimated in this fashion and then summed for the total PM10 emissions. The nine counties within the Bay Area were summed to get the District total. (The District’s portion of Solano and Sonoma Counties were 38% and 32%, respectively.) PM emissions are calculated by dividing PM10 value by 0.4543. Monthly Variation The monthly variations of emissions for the Bay Area counties in Category 749 were based on the ARB’s seasonal profile for agricultural land preparation emissions (Table 6, Agricultural Land Preparation, Section 7.4). For Category 1435, the monthly variations of emissions were based on ARB’s seasonal profile for agricultural harvest emissions (Table 4, Agricultural Harvest Operations, Section 7.5). County Distribution For both categories, the county distribution was based on the crop activity reported by the counties’ annual agricultural crop reports or the CASS. 10.2.2 Trends History For Category 749, the historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1987) and an annual activity increase factor of 1.00862 from 1986 back to 1967. This backcasting value represented the Bay Area’s annual activity increase (in acres) from 2010 going back to 1987.) For Category 1435, the historical growth profile was based on a combination of prior emissions data (back to 1987) and an annual activity increase factor of 1.00905 from 1986 back to 1967. This backcasting value represented the Bay Area’s annual activity increase (in acres) from 2010 going back to 1987.) Growth Projected emissions to 2030 for both categories were based on ARB’s growth profile for Agricultural Operations. For the Bay Area, this amounts to a 0.1% decrease in activity per year. For Categories 749 and 1435, the projected growth profile was based on emissions data from 2000 – 2010. The annual activity factors during this time period decreased by 0.004692 and 0.004777 per year, respectively. By: Stuart Schultz Date: January 2014 Base Year 2011 "],

The Structural Fires category is an area source category that includes residential and commercial buildings as well as mobile and trailer home fires. Methodology The methods used to calculate emissions for this category conforms to the methods used by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). The total number of structural accidental fires in California was acquired from the State Fire Marshal’s Office. Structural fires were apportioned to the Bay Area based on number of households in the Bay Area as compared to total California households. Structural losses. For building and mobile home fires, an average percent structural loss per fire was calculated by dividing the total monetary damage due to fires by the product of the average value of a residence in California and the number of residential fires. The result is an average loss of 7.3% per fire. According to census data and the National Association of Home Builders, the average residence has approximately 1,649 square feet of floor space and an average of 11,000 board feet of lumber in its structure. Assuming an average of one ton of material per 1000 board feet, an average residence would have approximately 11 tons of combustible material. With a rate of loss of 7.3%, the structural loss would be 0.80 tons per fire. Content losses. The National Bureau of Standards lists the combustible contents per square foot of the functional areas of the average home. These figures were multiplied by the percent of fires originally estimated to occur within each of these areas, and the products were then added to give a weighted average of 7.91 lb/sq. ft. as shown in Table 1.

Planned or prescribed fires such as weed burning, field crops, prunings, range improvement burning and forest management are covered in categories 315-319. Methodology Methodology for this category is in accordance with the California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) document “Methods for Assessing Area Source Emissions in California” for the Wildfires. Activity data (acreage burnt) estimates were obtained from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) and CARB. Wildfire emissions are calculated using the Geographic Information System (GIS) based Emission Estimating System (EES) model developed for ARB by UC Berkeley’s Center for the Assessment and Monitoring of Forest and Environmental Resources (CAMFER) laboratory.

Methodology The methodology for estimating particulate emissions from vehicular travel on paved roads was updated in the Final Section of Fifth Edition of U.S. EPA’s Compilation of Air Pollutant Emission Factors AP42 document, Volume I, Chapter 13.2.1. The methodology was adapted and refined for California by CARB. For a full description of this methodology and references, please see CARB’s methodology document “2013 Update_7 9 PavedRds Meth.pdf”. A brief description is given below: Emission rates are a function of vehicle weight and silt loading as shown in the following equation: \\[ E = k \\left(\\frac{sL}{2}\\right)^{0.91} \\times \\left(\\frac{W}{3}\\right)^{1.02} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{4N}\\right) \\] where: \\(E\\) is the particulate emission factor in grams per vehicle miles traveled (VMT); \\(k\\) is the particle size multiplier used to compute PM10 and PM2.5 (1.0 and 0.25 grams/mile respectively); \\(sL\\) is the roadway silt loading in grams per square meter; \\(W\\) is the average vehicle weight in tons; \\(P\\) is the number of “wet” days with at least 0.254 mm (0.01&quot;) of precipitation; and \\(N\\) is the number of days in the averaging period, 365 for yearly or 30 for monthly. California specific silt loading for different road types were measured in a study carried out by Midwest Research Institute (MRI) in 1995. Roads were divided into four classes with the corresponding silt loading factors (\\(g/m^2\\)): Road Type sL Freeway/Expressway 0.02 Major Street/Collector 0.032 Local Street 0.32 Rural 1.6 Average vehicle weight (\\(W\\)) was assumed to be 2.4 tons, based on vehicle counts performed during the MRI study. Estimated fraction of county VMT in each of the four roadway types were taken from 2008 data by Highway Performance Monitoring Systems (HPMS). County specific 2011 VMT data were taken from California Air Resources Board EMFAC2011-SG model. Number of wet days (\\(N\\)) for each county was derived from the most appropriate meteorological station for that county. The monthly fraction of annual VMT came from monthly Caltrans VMT highway data prepared for the Sacramento Office of the Federal Highway Administration. These were combined with the number of wet days in the relevant month to develop a monthly profile. 10.6.2 Trends History In previous base years, emissions from paved road dust travel were assumed to grow proportionally with VMT. According to this assumption, Bay Area road dust emissions should have increased by 30% between 1990 and 2011 based on growth in VMT. Ambient air monitoring data and chemical mass balance analysis do not show this trend. Growth It is believed that re-suspension of road dust quickly reaches an equilibrium condition. Thus, CARB proposed that instead of using VMT as a surrogate for growth, roadways center line miles (CLM) are used. MTC’s CLM data show an increase of less than 2% for the same period (less than 0.1% per year), and this was used to create trends around the 2011 base year emissions. By: A. K.

The methodology was developed by the California Air Resources Board. For a full description of this methodology and references, please see CARB’s methodology document “2012 Update_7 10 Unpaved Roads Dust Meth (2).pdf”. Four types of unpaved roads are considered: City and County; Parks and Forests; Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA); and Farm. Methodologies The city and county unpaved road mileage were taken from California Statewide Local Streets and Roads Needs Assessment (CSLSRNA), Final Report for the League of California Cities. This report shows that there are no unpaved roads under city and county jurisdiction in the Bay Area. For parks and forests, Caltrans’ Maintained Public Record Mileage for 2008 were used. The most recent available Caltrans Maintained Public Record Mileage containing BLM/BIA unpaved road mileage for 1998 was used. The report shows BLM/BIA unpaved roads in Sonoma county only. The total VMT for each type of road was estimated by assuming 10 miles of travel per day for each mile of unpaved road. For farm roads, county specific number of acres for various types of crops were taken from California County Agricultural Commissioners reports of 2008 harvested crop acreage. Crop specific VMT were applied to the harvested crop acreage for each county in the Bay Area to estimate county VMT. Emission factor for all types of road used is assumed to be 2.0 pounds of PM10 per vehicle mile traveled. This is the average of 22 unpaved road dust emission tests performed in San Joaquin Valley for light-duty truck traffic. The measurements were performed as part of studies by University of California, Davis (UCD) “Evaluation of the Emissions of PM10 Particulates from Unpaved Roads in the San Joaquin Valley, Final Report, April 1994” and the Desert Research Institute (DRI) “Effectiveness Demonstration of Fugitive Dust Control Methods for Public Unpaved Roads and Unpaved Shoulders of Paved Roads, Final Report, December 1996”. Emissions for 2011 were estimated using growth rates described in the following section. Temporal Variations It was assumed that wet days (with precipitation over 0.01&quot;) prevent these emissions from occurring. The VMT is also assumed to drop significantly during winter months. ARB combined these factor to develop monthly variations for each county. Activity is assumed to be the same during the week. Daily activity is assumed to take place primarily during the day. 10.7.2 Trends History Growth Two growth rates were used for these categories to estimate 1980-2030 emissions: For farm roads, annual activity was assumed to grow by agricultural production. This growth code was developed by ARB. For the remaining categories, in the absence of better data, annual variation activity was assumed to follow population by county. By: A. K.

Table 1 The table below shows livestock population in the Bay Area. county #1619 Dairy Cattle #1620 Range Cattle #1621 Broilers #1622 Layers #1623 Turkeys #1624 Swine #1625 Sheep #1626 Horses #1627 Other Livestock Alameda 3,623 22,381 332,045 442 0 80 1,266 1,943 228 Contra Costa 11,125 16,873 0 442 0 65 296 2,523 374 Marin 20,895 18,102 0 0 55,840 988 13,433 723 146 Napa 1,400 7,605 1,654,297 884 24,074 183 523 804 782 San Francisco 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 San Mateo 0 2,998 0 442 142 38 108 1,129 0 Santa Clara 2,392 17,604 0 141,802 0 158 744 2,815 136 Solano 3,353 7,732 0 442 0 63 28,753 691 70 Sonoma 19,997 12,626 978,348 297,298 62,392 327 8,762 1,633 547 Total 62,784 105,921 2,964,690 441,750 142,448 1,902 53,884 12,262 2,283 For each category, the emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factor and population of each animal type. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated evenly over the twelve months. County Distribution The county distribution was based on the cattle population in Table 1 the table above for the nine counties. History Emissions through the years were estimated based on the ARB’s growth profile on dollar values of Agricultural stock for each county. Growth The growth rate varies by county and by livestock and there is currently not a general surrogate to indicate the livestock growth or decline. In most cases, zero growth is assumed for livestock emissions, which is probably reasonable for most areas in the state. Projections to year 2030 are based on the ARB’s growth profile.

["animal-waste-other.html", "10.9 Animal Waste, Other", " 10.9 Animal Waste, Other 10.9.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from this category are from waste products of domestic animals (pets) and other native animals including dogs, cats, deer, and wild pigs. Methodology The animal population was estimated based on pet to human ratios taken from the report, “Evaluation of Emissions from Selected Uninventoried Sources in the State of California” by Dickson, R. and Tate, S. Population of dogs and cats was estimated based on this ratio with the population of each county. Of the wildlife animals, only deer and wild pigs were considered significant. Numbers of heads for these animals were made based on county land area ratios estimates by the Department of Fish and Game. The emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factor and population of each animal type. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated evenly over the twelve months. County Distribution The county distribution was based on dog population for the nine counties, and correspondingly, showed: Alameda-18.5%, Contra Costa-16.4%, Marin-4.6%, Napa- 2.9%, San Francisco-10.6%, San Mateo-12.9%, Santa Clara-21.9%, Solano-5.3%, and Sonoma-6.9%. 10.9.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated based on ARB’s relative values of dollar output for growth in Agriculture-stock of each county.

["sanitary-sewers.html", "10.10 Sanitary Sewers", " 10.10 Sanitary Sewers 10.10.1 Emissions Introduction This category includes organic compounds emissions from sanitary sewer lines in industrialized areas leading to sewage treatment plants. This category also includes waste material generated from portable or semi-permanent toilets and discharged to the sanitary sewer system. Methodology A report on “Evaluation of Emissions from Selected Uninventoried Sources in the State of California”, by R. Dickson; W.R. Oliver, and S. Tate showed an estimate of discharged material to the sewer systems in the United States. This estimate of national loading to sewers was adjusted for the Bay Area. In the report, about 50% of volatile organic compounds (VOC) was assumed from the discharged material volatilizes in the sewer prior to becoming influent to treatment plants. It was further assumed that 50% of the volatilized materials have already been accounted for in other categories, such as cleanup solvent. An emission factor of 250 lbs of organics per thousand pounds of industrial sewer loading was also developed based on the above report. The VOC Emissions are calculated by multiplying the throughput data with the emission factor. Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated based on estimated load throughout the year. County Distribution The county population was used to distribute emissions into each county. 10.10.2 Trends History Emissions through the years were estimated by using historical data on household population.

["wind-blown-dust.html", "10.11 Wind Blown Dust", " 10.11 Wind Blown Dust 10.11.1 Emissions Introduction Included in these categories are fugitive dust emissions resulting from wind erosion across agricultural fields (Category #764), and from wind erosion of soil on unpaved roads (Category #765). Methodologies Total acreage for field crops, vegetable crops, fruit and nut crops, nursery crops, plants, flowers and miscellaneous crops were obtained for each county as reported in the “Agricultural Crops”. The estimated crop acres were used as throughput for the calculation of wind erosion from agricultural fields (Category #764). The number of miles of unpaved road for each county were estimated from the “California Abstracts”, and converted into acreage. It was assumed a typical width of a road was 25 feet. The acreage of unpaved road was used as throughput for the calculation of windblown dust from unpaved roads (Category# 765). Particulate emission factor from dust emissions were developed based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s equation: \\[ \\text{Emission Factor} = E \\times I \\times C \\times K \\times L \\times V \\] where \\(E\\) = portion of total wind erosion loses as suspended particulates \\(I\\) = soil erodibility, t/acre/yr \\(C\\) = climatic factor \\(K\\) = surface roughness factor \\(L\\) = unsheltered field width factor \\(V\\) = vegetative cover factor (\\(K\\), \\(L\\), \\(V\\) depends on the crop type) Typical Values of above constants Agricultural Land Unpaved Roads E 0.025 .038 I 38 - 220 86, 47, 56 C 0.15 0.15 K 0.8, 0.6, 0.1, 0.6 1.0 L 0.74, 0.83, 0.77, 0.56 .29 - .34 V 0.05, 0.91, 0.26, 0.26 1.0 Particulate emissions from agricultural windblown dust were calculated by multiplying the crop acres by the emission factors developed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, as above.

["cigarette-and-tobacco-smoke.html", "10.12 Cigarette and Tobacco Smoke", " 10.12 Cigarette and Tobacco Smoke 10.12.1 Emissions Introduction Emissions from tobacco smoking, particularly from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, are presented in this category. Mainstream smoke (MS), which is generated during puffs, is generally inhaled by the smoker and a small fraction is exhaled. Sidestream smoke (SS), or the smoke issued from the product between puffs, is viewed as the most important emissions. Burning cigarettes may include total particulate matter, nicotine, phenol, CO2, CO, NOx, NH3, hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde. Methodology Cigarette consumption was based on a report from Atmospheric Environment Journal, Vol. 21, No. 2, “Measuring Environmental Emissions from Tobacco Combustion: Sidestream Cigarette Smoke Literature Review”, by M.R. Guerin, Higgens, &amp; Senkins. The reported stated that about 48% of the smokers smoked less than a pack of cigarettes, 32% smoked one pack, 15% smoked two packs, and 5% smoked 2.5 packs or more per day. A recent finding showed that although there has been a decrease of adult smokers, there was also an increase in younger smokers, and therefore, it is still estimated 10% of the population (or 743,744 cigarette smokers) are still smoking regularly in the Bay Area. The cigarette consumption is estimated as followed: \\(743,744 \\times (48\\% \\times 0.5 + 32\\% \\times 1 + 15\\% \\times 2 + 5\\% \\times 2.5) \\times 20 = 14,651,759\\) cigarettes/day (or 5,477.47 tons cigarettes per year) Emission factors were derived based on the Table 1 of the report. category PM TOG NOx SO2 CO #766 Cigarette and Tobacco Smoke 81.86 6.021 3.849 0 71.18201 Monthly Variation Monthly distribution was estimated to be the same throughout the year.

["non-consumer-pesticides.html", "10.13 Non-Consumer Pesticides", " 10.13 Non-Consumer Pesticides 10.13.1 Emissions Introduction Categories 1190 – 1193 account for emissions from all pesticide usage for agricultural, commercial, and institutional purposes. Agricultural use includes pesticide applications to crops, rangelands, pastures, cemeteries, parks, golf courses, and along roadsides and railroad right-of-ways. Additionally, all post-harvest pesticide treatment of agricultural goods, along with pesticide use in poultry, fish production, and some livestock applications all fall under the agricultural definition. Non-agricultural use includes structural operators, professional gardeners, and (non-agricultural) pest control operators. These categories do not include pesticides sold from retail stores in small quantities for home consumers. Consumer pesticides are covered in consumer product categories 1494-1509. Prior to 1996, the agricultural and non-agricultural pesticide divisions each consisted of application and residual categories for both synthetic and non-synthetic pesticides. The District had eleven categories associated with non-consumer product pesticides. Creosote application was considered a separate category. In 1996, the two divisions (agriculture and non-agriculture) were broken down into methyl bromide and other categories. The creosote application category is now incorporated in both the agricultural and non-agricultural pesticide’s “Other” categories. Methodologies The following table lists the Pesticides Categories and their 2011 total organic emissions (TOG) in tons/day. Category CY2008 CY2009 CY2010 CY2011 Pollutant Unit #1190 Agricultural, Methyl Bromide 0.061 0.031 0.056 0.055 TOG ton/day #1191 Agricultural, Other 0.856 0.593 0.848 0.829 TOG ton/day #1192 Non-Ag/Consumer, Methyl Bromide 0.003 0.003 0.003 0.003 TOG ton/day #1193 Non-Ag/Consumer, Other 0.182 0.161 0.163 0.165 TOG ton/day The California Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) provided the pesticide use data to the California Air Resources Board (ARB). The TOG emissions data for the years 2005 to 2009 are actual data estimated from the DPR Pesticide Reports. For Categories 1190 and 1191, the 2010 and 2011 the TOG emissions were grown from the year 2007. The year 2007 is the mid-point of the 5 year average. (Both ARB and DPR agreed the use of a 5-year average of historical data as an adjusted value would account for weather and pest infestation variability in agricultural pesticide emissions.) For Categories 1192 and 1193, the 2010 and 2011 TOG emissions were grown from the year 2009. Monthly Variation Monthly activity variation data is based on pesticide usage data in the Bay Area. County Distribution The county distribution is also based on pesticide usage for each county in the District. 10.13.2 Trends Historical The historical growth profile for the agricultural pesticides categories (Cats. 1190 and 1191) was based on a combination of prior adjusted emissions data (1990 - 2011) and a growth profile (from DRI94/DPR) provided by ARB. Structural pesticide, Methyl Bromide (Cat. 1192) was phased out in 2001. Growth The annual growth profile for categories 1190 and 1191 is based on 2012 – 2030 data provided by CARB. Emission projections for category 1193 are based on household population growth in the Bay Area. Control The District does not currently have any regulations governing these categories; however the State of California Department of Pesticide Regulation has adopted regulations controlling various agricultural and structural pesticides. Additionally, the Federal EPA has phased out methyl bromide because of its ozone depleting potential. By: Stuart Schultz/Sukarn Claire Date: January 2014 Base Year: 2011 "],

["biogenic.html", "10.15 Biogenic", " 10.15 Biogenic 10.15.1 Emissions Introduction Living vegetation throughout the Bay Area produce the biogenic organic emissions covered by these four emission categories. (Such vegetation is considered to be part of the general group known as “area” sources). Chemical analysis of biogenic emissions by investigators has led to their being classified into four separate chemical groupings. This detail has been maintained in the four categories developed for this Base Year emission inventory, and covered by this methodology. Methodologies Emissions were obtained from a presentation at CARB’s EITEAC Meeting on May 19, 2004. Biogenic emissions were estimated using the ARB’s BEIGIS model. Model inputs include the California GAP Analysis Project, California Department of Water Resources crop reports, SCAG and SANDAG (councils of government) urban land use, and satellite-derived leaf area index (LAI) data. The BEIGIS model is driven by temperature and solar radiation, BVOC emission factors and specific leaf weight factors. Estimated average annual organic emissions, in tons per day, are: Category TOG Unit #784 Isoprene 57.04 ton/day #785 Alpha Pinene 18.48 ton/day #786 Monoterpene 19.99 ton/day #787 Other Biogenic Organics 14.75 ton/day Monthly variation The monthly profile was estimated using monthly average ambient temperatures for the Bay Area. This information was obtained from the Climatological Summary Report from the National Climatic Document Center in North Carolina. County Distribution Data for each county consisted of four estimated emissions for the four organic compound classes represented by the categories covered by this methodology. 10.15.2 Trends History Prior to 2005, biogenic emissions were provided by Keith Baugues, EPA Source Receptor Analysis Branch of the Technical Support Division, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina.

["ozone-depleting-substance-ods-substitutes.html", "10.16 Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Substitutes", " 10.16 Ozone Depleting Substance (ODS) Substitutes 10.16.1 Emissions Introduction Ozone-depleting substances (ODS) are being phased out under the terms of the Montreal Protocol and the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. ODS include chlorofluorocarbons (CFC’s), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC’s), carbon tetrachloride, etc., and have been used in refrigeration and air conditioning equipment, solvent cleaning, foam production, sterilization, aerosol and fire extinguishing applications. The substitutes approved to replace the ODS include hydrofluorocarbons (HFC’s) and perfluorocarbons (PFC’s) emit both total organic gases (TOG) and greenhouse gases (GHG’s), many of which have high global warming potentials (GWP’s). All of the ODS Substitutes are non-reactive, so there are no reactive organic gas (ROG) emissions. The use of these ODS substitutes have steadily increased since 1990. Methodology The TOG and GHG emissions were estimated using California Air Resources Board’s (CARB’s) Documentation of California’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (6th Edition, updated August 1, 2013) data. CARB emission totals represented values for the entire state and were divided into 4 sectors (commercial, industrial, residential and transportation). Within each sector, the ODS Substitutes were further divided by usage (i.e. Aerosols, Fire Protection, Foams, Refrigeration and Air Conditioning, and Solvents, if applicable). The District’s portion of the State’s total was estimated by comparing 2011 data in Table B-3 (Total Population of California Counties), Table C-4 (“Wage and Salary Workers in Nonagricultural Establishments By Industry, California”) and Table C- 7 (“Wage and Salary Workers in Nonagricultural Establishments By Industry, California Metropolitan Areas”) of the California Department of Finances Statistical Abstract. For the residential sector, the population in the Bay Area District counties was compared to the State population. The number of Bay Area workers in the industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors were compared to the number of state workers in these sectors. In 2011, the fraction of Bay Area population and workers to that of State population and workers in the residential, industrial, commercial, and transportation sectors were 0.19, 0.14, 0.23, and 0.18, respectively. Each ODS Substitute, depending upon sector, was multiplied by this fraction and the State value. Monthly Variation Monthly variation of emissions for these categories is assumed to be uniform throughout the year. County Distribution The county distributions for these categories were based on Association of Bay Area Government’s (ABAG) 2009 Projections Data for 2011. For those emissions in the commercial, industrial, residential, and transportation sectors, ABAG’s data from retail employment, manufacturing and wholesale employment, population, and transportation and utility employment, respectively, were used. Each category may have a combination of aforementioned sectors, so a composite county fraction was calculated based on the sector’s emission (within the category). 10.16.2 Trends History Emission data from 1990 – 1999 was based on trend data from CARB’s 1990 – 2004 GHG Inventory by IPCC Category. Emission data from 2000 - 2010 was based on emission data from CARB’s 2000 – 2011 GHG Inventory by IPCC Category. Growth FIXME: Double-check whether these are consistent with the year-over-year changes in emissions (shown in figure above). BY2011 throughputs for these categories were not recorded in DataBank.

Right now, the list is static and mostly unsorted. (TODO: add tags and show these in a sortable, filterable table with “status”, “category”, “pollutant”, etc!) This list is hand-picked and shortened for teaching purposes. It’s intended to cover a subspace of the full gamut of issues. It is not intended to be a representative sample of the full gamut. 10.16.3 High Priority The CO2/CO ratio for category #293 Gas Fired Boilers for CY1990-2000 appears to be far too low, given what is observed for subsequent decades. (CH4/CO is also of interest) This could be resulting in the absence of 5-10 MMTCO2eq from the CY1990 BAAQMD inventory. An absence of CO2 of that magnitude, in CY1990, could be substantially distorting the answer to the key question of whether the District is “on track” to reach its CY2030 target. (Possibly related.) Emissions for #294 Oil Fired Boilers seem to be almost entirely absent from the BY2011 inventory. There are some very small emissions (~ 0.1 ton/yr of TOG and NOx) estimated for CY2008-2010, but that is it. TO BE CONTINUED… 10.16.4 Medium/Low Priority Category #305 Gas Fired Turbines shows a sharp up/down tick at CY2010. If you look at an RY pivot table, you can see that this is entirely due to one source. If you look at a PY pivot table, the effect disappears — that same source is very steady, year-over-year. It’s possible that an error existed at the time that the RY snapshot was made, but was fixed before the PY data were frozen. Categories #1930 and #1931 are missing data for CY2005-2008.
